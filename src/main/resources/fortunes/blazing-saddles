I spun around... and there I was, face to face with a six-year old kid. Well, I just threw my guns down and walked away. Little bastard shot me in the ass.

Bart: Well, uh... thank you, much obliged. Good night.
[Bart closes the window and smells the pie... but returns to the window when he hears another knock]
Elderly Woman: Of course, you'll have the good taste not to mention that I spoke to you.
Bart: Of course.
Elderly Woman: Thank you.

Bart: Just give me twenty-four hours to come up with a brilliant idea to save our town. Just twenty-four hours, that's all I ask.
Townspeople: [in unison] No!
Bart: You'd do it for Randolph Scott.
Townspeople: [reverently] Randolph Scott...
Townspeople: [singing in the fashion of a church choir] RANDOLPH SCOTT!
Howard Johnson: All right, Sheriff. Twenty-four hours.

Bart: [Bart dresses himself as a carnival barker and stands beside a wishing-well] ... Step right up, ladies and gentlemen and... Mongos! Dive, dive, dive for buried treasure! This is the exact spot where the Spanish Armada was sunk by the British Navy, leaving millions and millions of Spanish Dubloons at the bottom of the sea!
[Remember, they're in the middle of the desert, on America's Western Frontier!]
Mongo: Spanish balloons? Mongo take chance...!
[and, after suiting up]
Mongo: ... How Mongo get air?
Bart: From this wonderful antique pump. Good hunting!
[and, once Mongo climbs to the bottom of the well]
Bart: ... Time for my lunch break.
[He lowers a sign to Mongo which reads "For more air, deposit $.25"]

Bart: [watching Mongo's rampage] I don't know what it is.
[Van Johnson bursts into the office]
Van Johnson: Sheriff! Mongo's back! He's...
[realizes Bart is on the opposite side of the room, and turns around]
Van Johnson: Sheriff! Mongo's back! He's breaking up the whole town! You've got to help us, please!
Bart: Did you hear that? Now it's "please". This morning, I couldn't get the time of day. Who is this Mongo, anyway?
Jim: Well, Mongo ain't exactly a "who". He's more of a "what".
Van Johnson: What he said.
Bart: Well, now, I don't know...
Van Johnson: Oh, thank you, Sheriff! Oh, thank you very much! Thank you!
[runs to the door and flings it open]
Van Johnson: [shouting] The fool's going to... I mean, the sheriff's going to do it!

Bart: Hey, maybe you should eat somethin' first.
Jim: No thanks, food makes me sick.

Mongo: Mongo no go. Mongo stay with Sherrif Bart. Sherrif Bart first man ever whip Mongo. Mongo impressed. Have deep feelings for Sherrif Bart.
