X-rated movies are all alike ... the only thing they leave to the
imagination is the plot.
%
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18)
	A friend will step forward and confide in you about your breath.  Rely
	on your outgoing personality and winning smile to get you into a lot
	of trouble.  Be relaxed, things will change.  Look for a pink slip on
	payday.  Stop wetting your bed.
%
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18)
	You are the type of person who never has enough money to do what
	you want.  Don't expect things to get any better today, either.
	As a matter of fact they might get worse.  Intensify your
	relationship with your bank and any friends you have who might be
	able to lend you a few bucks.
%
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18)
	You have an inventive mind and are inclined to be progressive.
	You lie a great deal.  On the other hand, you are inclined to be
	careless and impractical, causing you to make the same mistakes over
	and over again.  People think you are stupid.
%
ARIES (Mar. 21 - Apr. 19)
	Be cheerful today. People who don't like you will outnumber those
	who do.  You have warts.  Focus on domestic status, financial matters,
	and venereal disease.  Look for involvement with Libra or Aquarius
	natives; probably a fistfight with one of each.
%
ARIES (Mar. 21 - Apr. 19)
	You are a wonderfully interesting, honest, hard-working person
	and you should make many new friends, but you won't because you've
	got a mean streak in you a mile wide.
%
ARIES (Mar. 21 - Apr. 19)
	You are the pioneer type and hold most people in contempt.  You
	are quick tempered, impatient, and scornful of advice.  You are
	not very nice.
%
Astrology... just a bunch of Taurus.
%
CANCER (June 21 - July 22)
	This is a good time for those of you who are rich and happy,
	but a poor time for those of you born under this sign who are
	poor and unhappy.  To tell you the truth, any day is tough
	when you're poor and unhappy.
%
CANCER (June 21 - July 22)
	You are sympathetic and understanding to other people's problems.
	They think you are a sucker.  You are always putting things off.
	That's why you'll never make anything of yourself.  Most welfare
	recipients are Cancer people.
%
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19)
	Follow your instincts.  You are much too scatterbrained to do anything
	else, such as think.  Romance is in the air, but not for you, so forget
	it.  That pimple on the end of your nose will get worse.
%
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19)
	Play your hunches.  This is a day when luck will play an important
	part in your life.  If you were smarter, you wouldn't need so much
	luck and you wouldn't be reading your horoscope, either.  You are
	a suspicious person, and it will occur to you that astrologers
	don't know what they're talking about any more than your Aunt Martha.
%
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19)
	You are conservative and afraid of taking risks.  You don't do
	much of anything and are lazy.  There has never been a Capricorn
	of any importance.  Capricorns should avoid standing still for
	too long as they tend to take root and become trees.
%
GEMINI (May 21 - June 20)
	A day to take the initiative.  Put the garbage out, for
	instance, and pick up the stuff at the dry cleaners.  Watch
	the mail carefully, although there won't be anything good
	in it today, either.
%
GEMINI (May 21 - June 20)
	Good news and bad news highlighted.  Enjoy the good news while you
	can; the bad news will make you forget it.  You will enjoy praise
	and respect from those around you; everybody loves a sucker.  A short
	trip is in the stars, possibly to the men's room.
%
GEMINI (May 21 - June 20)
	You are a quick and intelligent thinker.  People like you because
	you are bisexual.  However, you are inclined to expect too much
	for too little.  This means you are cheap.  Geminis are known for
	committing incest.
%

%
LEO (Jul. 23 - Aug. 22)
	You consider yourself a born leader.  Others think you are pushy.
	Most Leo people are bullies.  You are vain and dislike honest
	criticism.  Your arrogance is disgusting.  Leo people are thieves.
%
LEO (Jul. 23 - Aug. 22)
	Your determination and sense of humor will come to the fore.  Your
	ability to laugh at adversity will be a blessing because you've got
	a day coming you wouldn't believe.  As a matter of fact, if you can
	laugh at what happens to you today, you've got a sick sense of humor.
%
LEO (Jul. 23 - Aug. 22)
	Your presence, poise, charm and good looks won't even help you today.
	Look over your shoulder; an ugly person may be following you.  Be on
	your toes.  Brush your teeth.  Take Geritol.
%
LIBRA (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22)
	Major achievements, new friends, and a previously unexplored way
	to make a lot of money will come to a lot of people today, but
	unfortunately you won't be one of them.  Consider not getting out
	of bed today.
%
LIBRA (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22)
	You are the artistic type and have a difficult time with reality.
	If you are a man, you are more than likely gay.  Chances for
	employment and monetary gains are excellent.  Most Libra women
	are prostitutes.  All Libra people die of venereal disease.
%
LIBRA (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22)
	Your desire for justice and truth will be overshadowed by your
	desire for filthy lucre and a decent meal.  Be gracious and
	polite.  Someone is watching you, so stop staring like that.
%
PISCES (Feb. 19 - Mar. 20)
	Take the high road, look for the good things, carry the American
	Express card and a weapon.  The world is yours today, as nobody
	else wants it.  Your mortgage will be foreclosed.  You will probably
	get run over by a bus.
%
PISCES (Feb. 19 - Mar. 20)
	You have a vivid imagination and often think you are being followed
	by the CIA or FBI.  You have minor influence over your associates
	and people resent your flaunting of your power.  You lack confidence
	and you are generally a coward.  Pisces people do terrible things to
	small animals.
%
PISCES (Feb. 19 - Mar. 20)
	You will get some very interesting news of a promotion today. It
	will go to someone in the office you dislike and will be the job
	you wanted.  Don't lend anyone a car today.  You don't have a car.
%
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21)
	Move slowly today, be deliberate.  Indications are for bleeding
	ulcers.  Drink milk.  Try not to be your usual offensive and
	obnoxious self.  Call your mother.
%
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21)
	You are optimistic and enthusiastic.  You have a reckless
	tendency to rely on luck since you lack talent.  The majority
	of Sagittarians are drunks or dope fiends or both.  People
	laugh at you a great deal.
%
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21)
	Your efforts to help a little old lady cross a street will
	backfire when you learn that she was waiting for a bus.  Subdue
	impulse you have to push her out into traffic.
%
SCORPIO (Oct. 23 - Nov 21.)
	You are shrewd in business and cannot be trusted.  You will
	achieve the pinnacle of success because of your total lack of
	ethics.  Most Scorpio people are murdered.
%
SCORPIO (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21)
	Friends abound today, seeking repayment of past loans.  Smile.  Check
	for concealed weapons.  Your natural cheerfulness makes others want
	to throw up.  Knock it off.
%
SCORPIO (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21)
	You will receive word today that you are eligible to win a million
	dollars in prizes.  It will be from a magazine trying to get you to
	subscribe, and you're just dumb enough to think you've got a chance
	to win.  You never learn.
%
TAURUS (Apr. 20 - May 20)
	Let your self-confidence and determination shine, and people will
	find you boorish and headstrong.  Travel, promotion, and romance
	highlighted, if you live long enough.  Don't take any wooden nickels.
%
TAURUS (Apr. 20 - May 20)
	Take advantage of this opportunity to get a little extra sleep,
	because you're going to miss the bus again today anyway.  You will
	decide to lose weight today, just like yesterday.
%
TAURUS (Apr. 20 - May 20)
	You are practical and persistent.  You have a dogged determination
	and work like hell.  Most people think you are stubborn and bull
	headed.  You are a Communist.
%

VIRGO (Aug. 23 - Sep. 22)
	Get it in writing.  Be careful.  You are surrounded by lechers and
	assholes; birds of a feather flock together.  Trust no one.  People
	will not be offended, because they've come to recognize you for the
	paranoid neurotic that you are.  Your dentures are loose.
%
VIRGO (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22)
	Learn something new today, like how to spell or how to count
	to ten without using your fingers.  Be careful dressing this
	morning.  You may be hit by a car later in the day and you
	wouldn't want to be taken to the doctor's office in some of
	that old underwear you own.
%
VIRGO (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22)
	You are the logical type and hate disorder.  This nitpicking is
	sickening to your friends.  You are cold and unemotional and
	sometimes fall asleep while making love.  Virgos make good bus
	drivers.

YOUR FOAMY FUTURE
	by Miss Fortune

AQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18)
	You have nothing better to think about than what to wear and what
	type of champagne to take to the neighbors Halloween Party.  Just take
	beer!  Don't try to copy the "Joneses", pull them up to your level and
	remember, in California Hoalloween is redundant anyhow.

PISCES (Feb. 19 - Mar. 20)
	Focus on strengthening friendships this Fall.  You find others are
	fascinated by your intelligence, your wit, your drinking ability, and
	your bank account.  Just make sure you realize it's far more impressive
	when other discover your good qualities without your help.
%
YOUR FOAMY FUTURE
	by Miss Fortune

ARIES (Mar. 21 - Apr. 19)
	Matters are not good, where you health is concerned.  This Fall, be
	sure to "walk groundly, talk profoundly, drink roundly, and sleep
	soundly" and you will live all the days of your life.

TAURUS (Apr. 20 - May 20)
	You spent a fortune on beer this past summer and now find yourself
	in a deep depression because you can't afford even one of your favorite
	brewskis.  Don't fret too much, Taurus.  To get back on your feet
	simply miss two car payments.

GEMINI (May 21 - June 21)
	You think you're falling in love with a person who has a lot in
	common with yourself.  You both prefer ales, you've both tried your
	hand at homebrewing, and you both want to visit every new brewpub that
	opens.  Sounds impressive but remember you really don't know your
	partner until you meet in court.
%
YOUR FOAMY FUTURE
	by Miss Fortune

CANCER (June 22 - July 22)
	You've been awarded a clean bill of health this month and you feel you
	owe it all to the excessive amount of Vitamin B, Iron, and Malt you get
	in your beer.  Being healthy is admirable but don't you think you're
	going to feel stupid one day lying in a hospital dying of nothing?

LEO (July 23 - Aug. 22)
	You will soon acquire a large sum of money and will be in seventh
	heaven as you head to the nearest Liquor Barn and buy all the beer they
	have in stock.  Whoever said money couldn't buy happiness didn't know
	where to shop.

VIRGO (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22)
	Your late night, beer drinking, "life in the fast lane" parties are
	affecting your job production the next morning.  You feel a nine to
	five job is not for a "party animal" such as yourself and may feel
	the need for a career change.  Just remember, people who work sitting
	down get paid more than people who work standing up.
%
YOUR FOAMY FUTURE
	by Miss Fortune

SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 21)
	"Hard work never killed anybody, but why take the chance?" is your
	motto.  You don't do much other than sleep, eat, down brewskis, and
	watch TV.  Your friends and family are constantly pestering you to
	clean up your act.  But it's OK, Scorpio.  A kick in the ass is at
	least one step forward.

SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21)
	You've been on a diet for two weeks and all you've lost is two weeks.
	My advice is to drink copius amounts of beer just to get the thought
	of food out of your mind.  Remember, a good reducing exercise consists
	of placing both hands against the table edge and pushing back.

CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19)
	Remember that day you had one beer too many and did something
	extremely foolish?  Now your friends are coming and going and your
	enemies accumulating.  Cheer up!  All is not lost.  It's better to
	be hated for what you are than loved for what you're not.

 I don't care if it rains or freezes
 Long as I have my plastic Jesus
 Riding on the dashboard of my car
 Through my trials and tribulations
 And my travels through the nations
 With my plastic Jesus I'll go far

 Plastic Jesus, plastic Jesus
 Riding on the dashboard of my car
 I'm afraid he'll have to go
 His magnets ruin my radio
 And if I have a wreck He'll leave a scar

 Riding down a thoroughfare
 With his nose up in the air
 A wreck may be ahead but he don't mind
 Trouble coming He don't see
 He just keeps his eye on me
 And any other thing that lies behind

 Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
 Riding on the dashboard of my car
 Though the sunshine on His back
 Make Him peel, chip and crack
 A little patching keeps Him up to par

 When pedestrians try to cross
 I let them know who's boss
 I never blow the horn or give them warning
 I ride all over town
 trying to run them down
 And it's seldom that they live to see the morning

 Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
 Riding on the dashboard of my car
 His halo fits just right
 And I use it for a sight
 And they'll scatter or they'll splatter near and far

 When I'm in a traffic jam
 He don't care if I say "damn"
 I can let all sorts of curses roll
 Plastic Jesus doesn't hear
 For he has a plastic ear
 The man who invented plastic saved my soul

 Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
 Riding on the dashboard of my car
 Once His robe was snowy white
 Now it isn't quite bright
 Stained by the smoke of my cigar

 If I weave around at night
 And the police think I'm tight
 They'll never find my bottle though they ask
 Plastic Jesus shelters me
 For his head comes off you see
 He's hollow and I use Him for a flask

 Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
 Riding on the dashboard of my car
 Ride with me and have a dram
 Of the blood of the Lamb
 Plastic Jesus is a holy bar.

   ["Plastic Jesus", circa 1969, sign-on
    song of disk jockey Don Imis]

Dressed in rhinestones sitting on a
Pedestal of abalone shell
Going ninety I aint scary
Cause I've got the virgin mary
Telling me that I won't go to hell.

SUNDAY SERMON

A technician, wrapped in a stiff, white smock,
 takes an albino rat from the big crate
 delivered just that morning, puts it in
 the God Model Box, leaves and locks the room.
The box, with random corners and angles,
 is monitored by a ceiling mounted
 video camera.
A switch mounted in one corner is well
 protected by spring wire traps, barriers
 and rat repellent.
The switch delivers an electric shock
 when touched by the rat.
The experiment lasts 24 hours
 or so, depending on the whim and will
 of the technician.
If during that time, the rat sits on the
 switch for thirty or forty seconds,
 the technician will set it free in the
 field behind the fence.
Otherwise, he will restrain the rat in
 a vice and slowly pull off its tail and
 its legs, one by one, then skin it and leave
 it to die
 slowly.

Little is learned in this experiment
 either by the rat or the technician
 who is not at all surprised that none of
 rats ever perform the required task.
But the technician does get to skin a
 lot of rats, and he likes to hear them squeal.

"...And no philosophy, sadly, has all the answers.  No matter how assured
 we may be about certain aspects of our belief, there are always painful
 inconsistencies, exceptions, and contradictions.  This is true in religion as
 it is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the naive.
 As for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we might be
 advised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do us the
 same courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever their
 protestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clear
 that they are easily disposed to restore to the sword.  My own belief in
 God, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect
 for Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the
 most virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christians
 are frustated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure
 of Jesus because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.
 Such ambiguity is not apparent to children or fanatics, but every
 recognized Bible scholar is perfectly aware of it.  Some Christians, alas,
 resort to formal lying to obscure such reality."

"As I argued in "Beloved Son", a book about my son Brian and the subject

 has, after eleven years, left the sect he was associated with.  The
 problem is that once the untrained mind has made a formal commitment to
 a religious philosophy -- and it does not matter whether that philosophy
 is generally reasonable and high-minded or utterly bizarre and
 irrational -- the powers of reason are suprisingly ineffective in
 changing the believer's mind."

 not. Stein, 822 F.2d at 1409; 908 F.2d 1090, 1098-1099 (CA1 1990)

 defined which permits once conflicting faiths to express the shared conviction

 sense of community and purpose sought by all decent societies might be
 advanced. But though the First Amendment does not allow the government to
 stifle prayers which aspire to these ends, neither does it permit the

"The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed. Our authority
 is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as the light of
 the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven
 days."  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much radiation as we do from
 the Sun, and in addition 7*7 (49) times as much as the Earth does from the
 Sun, or 50 times in all.  The light we receive from the Moon is one
 1/10,000 of the light we receive from the Sun, so we can ignore that ...
 The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where the heat
 lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation, i.e.,
 Heaven loses 50 times as much heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using the
 Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E) temperature of the earth (-300K),
 gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact temperature of Hell cannot be computed...
 (However) Revelations 21:8 says "But the fearful, and unbelieving ... shall
 have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone."  A lake
 of molten brimstone means that its temperature must be at or below the
 boiling point, 444.6C. We have, then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than
 Hell at 445C."

"When someone comes and proselytizes for another god or another final authority
 (and by the way, that god may be man)--when someone tries to undermine the
 commitment to Jehovah which is fundamental to the civil order of a godly
 state--then that person needs to be restrained by the magistrate. However,
 this does not mean that individuals should be punished for holding heretical
 views, the views that Baptists think are heretical or Lutherans think are
 heretical and so forth. It simply means that those who will not acknowledge
 Jehovah as the ultimate authority behind the civil law code which the
 magistrate is enforcing would be punished and repressed. You would, therefore,
 be open, I believe, to hold Muslim views or Hindu views in the privacy of your
 own home, provided it was not a Christian home that you've now come into to
 subvert and draw away from Jehovah. You would be able to hold these views as a
 private conviction.  But you would not be allowed to proselytize and undermine
 the order of the state. Before people who are non-theonomists get too terribly
 upset about this view, I would at least ask them to reflect on this fact:
 every civil order protects its foundations."

 degrees of divine inspiration; humanity is divided into men highly inspired,
 less inspired, uninspired.  All are equally insignificant before God, it is
 true; but compared with each other, some are greater than others; not only
 in fact- which would be of no consequence, because inequality in fact is
 lost in the collectivity when it cannot cling to some legal fiction or
 institution- but by the divine right of inspiration, which immediately
 establishes a fixed, constant, petrifying inequality.  The highly inspired
 must be listened to and obeyed by the less inspired, and the less inspired
 by the uninspired.  Thus we have the principle of authority well established,

 registering the choices we make in the way we operate and no way for our

 Will we honor our gifts or betray them?  If we betray ourselves and our
 powers, if we live mindlessly, purposelessly, and without integrity, can
 we buy our way out, can we acquire self-esteem, by claiming to be God's
 relatives?  Do we imagine we can thus relieve ourselves of personal

 Not in the sense that Christianity is the established religion or the

 Constitution specifically provides that 'congress shall make no law

 thereof.' Neither is it Christian in the sense that all its citizens are

 free scope within its borders. Numbers of our people profess other
 religions, and many reject all.  Nor is it Christian in the sense that a

 was by 'pressing'; heavy stones were placed upon his chest in an attempt to
 force him to plead [he protected his kin by refusing to plead either way].

 was caught up in it before the affair had run its course, and at least one
 witch was found in Maine.  Salem was not, as a matter of fact, even the first

"It is a common saying that thought is free.  A man can never be hindered from
 thinking whatever he chooses so long as he conceals what he thinks.  The
 working of his mind is limited only by the bounds of his experience and the
 power of his imagination.  But this natural liberty of private thinking is of
 little value.  It is unsatisfactory and even painful to the thinker himself,
 if he is not permitted to communicate his thoughts to others, and it is
 obviously of no value to his neighbors.  Moreover it is extremely difficult
 to hide thoughts that have any power over the mind.  If a man's thinking leads
 him to call in question ideas and customs which regulate the behaviour of
 those about him, to reject the beliefs which they hold, to see better ways of
 life than those they follow, it is almost impossible for him, if he is
 convinced of the truth of his own reasoning, not to betray by silence, chance
 words, or general attitude that he is different from them and does not share
 their opinions.  Some have preferred, like Socrates, some would prefer today,

 to do anything but what he fully understands.  He is assured that this is
 the sin of pride, but he does not understand the notion of sin;  that
 perhaps hell is in store, but he has not enough imagination to visualize
 that strange future;  that he is losing immortal life, but that seems to
 him an idle consideration.  An attempt is made to get him to admit his
 guilt.  He feels innocent.  To tell the truth, that is all he feels --
 his irreparable innocence.  This is what allows him everything.  Hence,
 what he demands of himself is to live /solely/ with what he knows, to
 accommodate himself with what is, and to bring in nothing that is not
 certain.  He is told that nothing is.  But this at least is certainty.

"Despite the suppression of thought, as humankind became more sophisticated
 in its knowledge of the workings of nature, it was only natural that some
 people began to question the efficacy of the priests and their magical
 rituals. Indeed, as people became aware of natural causes, they began to
 question the very existence of the gods themselves. The priests' answer to
 this skepticism was twofold: invoking the power of the state to exterminate
 dangerous freethought, and concurrently developing even more complex,
 serpentine, theological logic. Many philosophers were not taken in by this
 specious reasoning. They demonstrated that, fundamentally, all theology and
 metaphysics is pseudolearning, a semantic sleight of hand to give the
 appearance that superstitious beliefs have an intellectual, rational
 foundation. They further showed that, by definition, God, if he existed,
 would be unknowable. Yet theology--bolstered by the semantic alchemy of
 metaphysics--attempted to discuss God as if he could be discovered by
 reason or experience."

 Probably it originated many times by independent 'mutation.' In any case,
 it is very old indeed. How does it replicate itself? By the spoken and
 written word, aided by great music and great art. Why does it have such
 high survival value? Remember that 'survival value' here does not mean
 value for a gene in a gene pool, but value for a meme in a meme pool. The
 question really means: What is it about the idea of a god that gives it its
 stability and penetrance in the cultural environment? The survival value of
 the god meme in the meme pool results from its great psychological appeal.
 It provides a superficially plausible answer to deep and troubling
 questions about existence. It suggests that injustices in this world may be
 rectified in the next. The 'everlasting arms' hold out a cushion against
 our own inadequacies which, like a doctor's placebo, is none the less
 effective for being imaginary. There are some of the reasons why the idea

 Nothing is more lethal for certain kinds of meme than a tendency to look

"Science offers us an explanation of how complexity (the difficult) arose
 out of simplicity (the easy).  The hypothesis of God offers no worthwhile
 explanation for anything, for it simply postulates what we are trying to
 explain.  It postulates the difficult to explain, and leaves it at that.
 We cannot prove that there is no God, but we can safely conclude the He
 is very, very improbable indeed."

"The analogy between telescope and eye, between watch and living organism, is
 false. All appearances to the contrary, the only watchmaker in nature is the
 blind forces of physics, albeit deployed in a very special way. A true
 watchmaker has foresight: he designs his cogs and springs, and plans their
 interconnections, with a future purpose in his mind's eye. Natural selection,
 the blind, unconscious, automatic process which Darwin discovered, and which
 we now know is the explanation for the existence and apparently purposeful
 form of all life, has no purpose in mind. It has no mind and no mind's eye.
 It does not plan for the future. It has no vision, no foresight, no sight at
 all. If it can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, it is the
 blind watchmaker."

 that, the world over, the vast majority of children follow the religion of
 their parents rather than any of the other available religions. Instructions
 to genuflect, to bow towards Mecca, to nod one's head rhythmically towards
 the wall, to shake like a maniac, to ``speak in tongues'' --- the list of

"If you have a faith, it is statistically overwhelmingly likely that it
 is the same faith as your parents and grandparents had. No doubt soaring
 cathedrals, stirring music, moving stories and parables, help a bit.
 But by far the most important variable determining your religion is the
 accident of birth.  The convictions that you so passionately believe
 would have been a completely different, and largely contradictory, set
 of convictions, if only you had happened to be born in a different place.

 the best music: when it comes to choosing from the smorgasbord of available
 religions, their potential virtues seem to count for nothing, compared to
 the matter of heredity.  This is an unmistakable fact; nobody could
 seriously deny it. Yet people with full knowledge of the arbitrary nature
 of this heredity, somehow manage to go on believing in *their* religion,
 often with such fanaticism that they are prepared to murder people who

"It is often said, mainly by the "no-contests", that although there is no
 positive evidence for the existence of God, nor is there evidence against
 his existence.  So it is best to keep an open mind and be agnostic. At first
 sight that seems an unassailable position, at least in the weak sense of
 Pascal's wager. But on second thoughts it seems a cop-out, because the same
 could be said of Father Christmas and tooth fairies.  There may be fairies at
 the bottom of the garden. There is no evidence for it, but you can't *prove*
 that there aren't any, so shouldn't we be agnostic with respect to fairies?"

 of superstrings or the value of Planck's constant is a profound mystery.
 It has obviously not the smallest connection with a being capable of
 forgiving sins, a being who might listen to prayers, who cares about
 whether or not the Sabbath begins at 5pm or 6pm, whether you wear a veil
 or have a bit of arm showing; and no connection whatever with a being

"Already the spirit of our schooling is permeated with the feeling that
 every subject, every topic, every fact, every professed truth must be
 submitted to a certain publicity and impartiality.  All proffered
 samples of learning must go to the same assay-room and be subjected to
 common tests.  It is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that
 any such "show-down" is sacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristic
 of religion, from their point of view, is that it is intellectually
 secret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generally known;
 authoritatively declared, not communicated and tested in ordinary
 ways...It is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion is
 conceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists,
 there is something self-contradictory in speaking of education in
 religion in the same sense in which we speak of education in topics
 where the method of free inquiry has made its way.  The "religious"
 would be the last to be willing that either the history or the
 content of religion should be taught in this spirit; while those
 to whom the scientific standpoint is not merely a technical device,
 but is the embodiment of the integrity of mind, must protest against
 its being taught in any other spirit.

"Faith will survive all superstitions, compelling men to think in terms of
 their own destiny and the responsibility they themselves have in forging
 that destiny. No one explains how declarations that are manufactured out of
 whole cloth, that have absolutely no predictive content and therefore no
 demonstrable connection with our lives as we live them day by day, are
 supposed to serve as a guide for planning our future. What such declarations
 do is to condition every nervous system that takes them seriously that it is
 perfectly sane to ignore the world in which we live, and to live instead in
 a world of pure fantasy. The man who is willing to accept the doctrine of
 Christian faith is one who is willing to relinquish all hope of knowing the
 truth. He accepts all, doubts never, vegetates. He is a slave, a hollow shell
 into which others can pour all manner of stupidities. Having a conscience,
 being honest, are empty phrases for him, as he has relinquished his own right
 to think and is acting only because others are acting through him. He refuses
 to be honest with himself, no longer talks things over with himself, no longer
 meditates, contemplates; he only absorbs like a sponge, without discrimination.
 If he has convictions, they are metamorphized and petrified lies, and not even
 his own lies but those of colleagues, priests, and politicians who want to use
 him. If to accept blindly, without the play of reason, is faith, it follows
 then that what the world needs is not more faith, but more people who think
 with their own heads and not with the heads of others."

"Faith in the sense that religionists use the term, it turns out, is
 equivalent to the loss of confidence of the individuals of the human

 out by the adherence to religion among the poor, the spread of religion
 in times of depression and conflict, and the greater success of all
 religions to proselytize among deprived populations wherever they may be.
 It may also explain the lack of initiative clearly evident among the
 fanatically religious who see little point in struggling for a better
 world when they are only nonentities in a vast system of omnipotent
 forces and obscure agencies beyond their abilities to understand or
 control. Men who are liberated from all such folderol are able to work

"Reason and faith are completely irreconcilable pathways to knowledge. The two
 cannot exist side by side. Reason underlies the methodology of the scientist.
 Without it he would be ineffectual. Faith is the "being" of the "religionist."
 Without it he could not exist. The scientist accepts nothing on faith. Faith
 to him is a synonym for belief. In Hebrews 11:1 we read: "Faith is the
 substance of things desired, the evidence of things unseen." The "religionist"
 is ever alert to prevent reason from undermining his precepts. Reason is his
 (and God's) worst enemy. Reason is our means of processing what we learn of
 the world through our proverbial five senses. Faith does no processing;
 whatever sense (or nonsense) is accepted as is, without rational consideration.
 Those facts which reason allows us to accept must display consistency and
 predictability. There are no criteria to restrict that which we will accept
 on faith, as section 61 of this book shows. Those content to accept on faith
 are those who accept without thinking, without the rational demonstrations
 that establish the truth (predictive content) of what we believe. Faith is
 the road to myth and error, the way to add to man's already overflowing
 storehouse of "things he _knows_ but that are not so."

"Transactional psychologists have verified what most of us have known
 intuitively all along: that the stronger are a person's motives for certain
 interpretations of the data confronting him, the more likely are the chances
 that those will be the interpretations he will come up with, even though they
 be radically wrong. Said Andre Gide in 'Pretexts,' "Most often people seek in
 life occasions for persisting in their opinions rather than for educating
 themselves.... It seems as if the mind enjoys nothing more than sinking
 deeper into error." The person with the self-sealing system that Oppenheimer
 describes (section 18) cannot be convinced at all. He has become uncannily
 proficient at transmuting all experiential verification to conform to that
 which he wants to believe. He now has adequate defenses against countervailing
 evidence to discount almost anything that would prove detrimental to his
 cherished beliefs, to revamp information that threatens long-established
 convictions. Religious faith (which is just such a closed system), if strong
 enough, will protect a person from the arguments appearing in a book such as
 this, just as the faith of people who want to believe that their destinies
 lie in the stars is enough to protect them from the declarations of 186 noted
 scientists who feel it important to convince them that they are wrong.
 Bertrand Russell was talking about this kind of "religious" faith when, in
 'Human Society in Ethics and Politics', he tells us that he believes that all
 faiths do harm.  He defines faith as the belief in anything for which no
 evidence exists. If there is evidence, faith is not required. We do not need
 faith to believe that vinegar is bitter or that water is wet. We use the term
 faith only when emotion dominates reason. Faith, for Mencken, was a kind of
 clearing house for all the various conspiracies religionists contrive in order
 to deny or distort the facts that our senses present to us to make up what we
 call our existence. Faith, he was sure, is the force that foments the
 concerted attacks against what can be called a rational moral philosophy."

"But there is a kind of faith, as we all well know, that is an essential
 ingredient in the lives of all human beings. This faith is of a different
 sort, not faith in (or in the existence of) a pathologically jealous supreme
 being who would have us all wasting our valuable time in endless, meaningless
 rituals "glorifying his name." Nor is it faith in a mythological hell in
 which we will all fry for eternity who do not genuflect to this demeaning
 concept of the utter dependence of the human species. Alan Watts says in
 'The Book,' "Irrevocable commitment to any religion is not only intellectual
 suicide; it is positive unfaith because it closes the mind to any new vision
 of the world. Faith is, above all, openness - an act of trust in the unknown."
 What we need is faith in the boundless reach of an open mind. Having an open
 mind does not mean that we do not have firm convictions, but that we are not
 afraid of new ideas. Persons with firm convictions, well founded, need new
 ideas from time to time, against which they can constantly test their
 convictions in a changing world, perhaps to alter them or perhaps to make
 their convictions even more firm. If we are confident of the truth and
 validity of our convictions, whatever they may be, we have nothing to fear.
 We shall not serve our convictions, whatever they may be, by self-deception.
 Convictions that can be defended only by disregarding facts, lying to
 oneself and others, are not worth keeping."

 earth will continue to turn on its axis, and the sun will continue for a few
 billion more years to warm the earth, and that there will be rain to make the
 plants grow and thus to maintain life on this planet. The very world itself is
 a matter of faith. It is an act of faith to believe that there exists a world
 beyond our own skins. Our faith is not to deny the unknown, to avoid it, or to
 pretend that the unknown is really known. Our faith is above all resolute
 belief in ourselves as sovereign individuals. We must understand that beyond
 ourselves there is no baleful influence bent on frustrating our hopes and
 plans - even those plagued constantly with difficulties. Nature, we must
 understand, is not deliberately malign nor deliberately benign; it is simply
 indifferent. With Amado Nervo (who gets the last word in this essay), we must

 fancy, arbitrary assumption, or capricious conviction. It can be both horse
 and vehicle, north and south, sinister and dexter, verso and recto, larboard

"Just as Philo, learned in Greek speculation, had felt a need to rephrase
 Judaism in forms acceptable to the logic-loving Greeks, so John, having
 lived for two generations in a Hellenistic environment, sought to give a
 Greek philosophical tinge to the mystic Jewish doctrine that the Wisdom
 of God was a living being, and to the Christian doctrine that Jesus was
 the Messiah. Consciously or not, he continued Paul's work of detaching
 Christianity from Judaism. Christ was no longer presented as a Jew, living
 more or less under the Jewish Law; he was make to address the Jews as
 "you," and to speak of their Law as "yours"; he was not a Messiah sent
 "to save the lost sheep of Israel," he was the coeternal Son of God; not
 merely the future judge of mankind, but the primeval creator of the
 universe. In this perspective the Jewish life of the man Jesus could
 be put into the background, faded almost as in Gnostic heresy; and the
 god Christ was assimilated to the religious and philosophical traditions
 of the Hellenistic mind. Now the pagan world-- even the anti-Semitic
 world--could accept him as its own."

"Christianity did not destroy paganism; it adopted it. The Greek mind
 dying, came to a tranmigrated life in the theology and liturgy of the
 Church; the Greek language, having reigned for centuries over philosophy,
 became the vehicle of Christian literature and ritual; the Greek mysteries
 passed down into the impressive mystery of the Mass.  Other pagan cultures
 contributed to the syncretist result. From Egypt came the ideas of a divine
 trinity, the Last Judgement, and a personal immortality of reward and
 punishment; from Egypt the adoration of the Mother and Child, and the mystic
 theosophy that made Neoplatonism and Gnosticism, and obscured the Christian
 creed; there, too, Christian moanasticism would find itsw exemplars and its
 source. From Phrygia came the worship of the Great Mother; from Syria the
 resurrection drama of Adonis; from Thrace, perhaps the cult of Dionysus, the
 dying and saving god. From Persia came millennarianism, the "ages of the
 world," the "final conflagration," the dualism of Satan and God, of Darkness
 and Light; already in the Forth Gospel Christ is the "Light shining in the
 darkness, and the darkness has never put it out." The Mithraic ritual so
 closely resemled the eucharistic sacrifice of the Mass that Christian fathers
 charged the Devil with inventing these similarities to mislead frail minds.

"In an early class, one of the students asked me if I believed in God.  I
 replied, 'I don't think so.' And then proceeded to wail on the theme, using
 material from this column of some weeks ago, in which I observed the
 perpetuation of insanity on this planet through the mediums of Arabs-vs-Jews,
 Catholics-vs-Protestants, Southern Baptists-vs-Everyone.  I said I felt if
 'God created man in his *own* image, in the image of God created he them,'
 (Genesis 2:27, King James's italics, not mine) then *we* were God.  And when
 Man (*my* cap, not King James's) in his most creative, his most loving, his
 most gentle and most human, then he is most God-like.
 The student said he would pray for my immortal soul.  He also asked for my
 address, so he could send me some literature on the subject of God.  I
 thanked him politely and told him I'd gotten all the literature I could
 handle on the subject from a certain Thomas Aquinas."

 chief crime in the first class, cognizable by temporal courts, is
 blasphemy, under which may be included atheism.  This crime consists in
 denying or vilifying the Deity, by speech or writing.  All who curse God

"To sum up (or I shall be pursuing the infinite), it is quite clear
 that the Christian religion has a kind of kinship with folly in some
 form, though it has none at all with wisdom.  If you want proofs of this,
 first consider the fact that the very young and the very old, women and
 simpletons, are the people who take the greatest delight in sacred and
 holy things, and are therefore always found nearest the altars, led there
 doubtless solely by their natural instinct.  Secondly, you can see how
 the first great founders of the faith were great lovers of simplicity and
 bitter enemies of learning.  Finally, the biggest fools of all appear to
 be those who have once been wholly possessed by zeal for Christian
 piety.  They squander their possessions, ignore insults, submit to being
 cheated, make no distinction between friends and enemies, shun pleasure,
 sustain themselves on fasting, vigils, tears, toil and humilations, scorn
 life and desire only death - in short, they seem to be dead to any normal
 feelings, as if their spirit dwelt elsewhere than in their body.  What else
 can that be but madness?  And so we should not be surprised if the apostles

"She had the dubious distinction of being known as America's most outspoken
 atheist," NBC's Tom Brokaw said (9/30/96) in introducing a jokey segment
 on Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who has been missing for the past year. It's
 impossible to imagine Brokaw making light of the disappearance of someone
 who has the "dubious distinction" of being a leader of America's Catholics
 or Jews--but atheists are assumed to be fair game for ridicule or attack.
 That must be why NBC quoted a "conservative Christian commentator" as saying
 of O'Hair: "If she is indeed dead, then she's burning in the fires of hell."

North Dakota, Texas, Maine,
New Hampshire,
Ohio and New York, of course.

The forty-eight contiguous,
And the two ambiguous.
The greatest country God ever saved from the pagans.

And while we're at it, dear Lord, bless the Reagans.

 of symbolizing its new birth at passing into Catholic hands.  Thereafter it
 was catechized, and obliged to recant and promise that it would never again
 relapse into sin.  Having made this ample and honourable amends, the bell was
 reconciled, baptized, and given, or rather sold, to the parish of St.
 Bartholomew.  But when the governer sent in the bill for the bell to the

"While the different religions wrangle with one another as to which of them
 is in possession of the truth, in our view the truth of religion may be
 altogether disregarded.  Religion is an attempt to get control over the
 sensory world, in which we are placed, by means of the wish-world, which
 we have developed inside us as a result of biological and psychological
 necessities.  But it cannot achieve its end.  Its doctrines carry with them
 the stamp of the times in which they originated, the ignorant childhood days
 of the human race.  Its consolations deserve no trust.  Experience teaches
 us that the world is not a nursery.  The ethical commands, to which religion
 seeks to lend its weight, require some other foundations instead, for human
 society cannot do without them, and it is dangerous to link up obedience to
 them with religious belief. If one attempts to assign to religion its place
 in man's evolution, it seems not so much to be a lasting acquisition, as a
 parallel to the neurosis which the civilized individual must pass through

 greater justice than St. Paul ever dreamed of. Because men are growing grand
 enough to recongize the fact that right is not masculine only, and that
 justice knows no sex. And because the church no longer makes the laws.
 Saints have been retired from the legal profession. I can't recall the name
 of a single one who is practicing law now. Have any of you ever met a saint
 at the bar? Women are indebted to-day for their emancipation from a position
 of hopeless degradation, not to their religion nor to Jehovah, but to the

"As the happiness of a future life is the great object of religion, we may hear
 without surprise or scandal that the introduction, or at least the abuse, of
 Christianity had some influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire.
 The clergy successfully preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity;
 the active virtues of society were discouraged; and the last remains of
 military spirit were buried in the cloister. A large portion of public and
 private wealth was consecrated to the specious demands of charity and
 devotion, and the soldiers' pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of
 both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity. Faith,
 Zeal, curiosity, and more earthly passions of malice and ambition kindled the
 flame of theological factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody and
 always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to
 synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new species of tyranny, and the
 persecuted sects became the secret enemies of the country."

"School vouchers as proposed by Reagan and Bush do not represent free market
 competition.  The reason is fairly simple.  The source of the money is not

 individuals who are not constrained by the prohibition against Congress
 passing laws respecting religion to spend tax dollars for the benefit of
 the religion of their choice.

 I have no objection to parents sending their children to the school of
 their choice.  The problem with public funding of schools is that it is an
 inherently collectivist system.  The restraints that have been placed on
 what public schools must teach and what they are prohibited from teaching
 protect us to a limited extend from the full magnitude of the damage that
 they have the potential to do if used as a propaganda tool.

 I have never granted that anyone else rightfully has the freedom to choose
 how my money will be spent.  The only difference between that and slavery is
 that the masters do not have the authority to beat, sell, or kill me if I

 way that you wish.  But do not insist on paying for it with money taken

 describes God and reports the commands and the characteristics of God. If
 there is a God, it is natural that we should wish to be quite correct in
 our understanding of that God's nature. So, we ask: Can and does God lie?

 Looking this point up in the mazes of Holy Writ, we discover confusion. In
 Numbers xxiii, 19, we are told: "God is not a man, that he should lie."
 This is put even mere strongly in Hebrews vi, 18, where we read: "It was
 impossible for God to lie."

 But do these citations settle the matter? Ah, no, we are upset in, our
 calculations the moment we turn to 2 Thessalonians ii, 11, where we read:
 "For this cause God shall send them strong delusions, that they should
 believe a lie." And in I Kings xxii, 23, God is thus reported: "Now,
 therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all
 these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee."

 There have been many alleged revelations of God. There have, indeed, been many
 Gods as there have been many Bibles. And in different ages and different lands
 an endless game of guessing and disputing has gone on. Men have argued blindly
 about God. They still argue -- just as blindly.

 And if there is a God, we must conclude that he has willfully left men in the
 dark. He has not wanted men to know about him. Assuming his existence, then
 it would follow that he would have perfect ability to give a complete and
 universal explanation of himself, so that all men could see and know without
 further uncertainty. A real God could exhibit himself clearly to all men and
 have all men following his will to the last letter without a doubt or a slip.

 But when we examine even cursorily the many contradictory revelations of God,
 the many theories and arguments, the many and diverse principles of piety, we
 perceive that all this talk about God his been merely the natural floundering

"A few weeks ago a hurricane struck the little religious community of Bethany,
 Okla. A number of pious citizens of the little town were killed. Houses were
 destroyed -- homes in which prayer and devotion reigned. A church was
 demolished.

 Only a few miles away is the large, wicked city of Oklahoma City -- at least
 we can certainly assume that, from the religious viewpoint, many sinners live
 in Oklahoma City. Assuming also (which is a great deal riskier assumption)
 that there is a God, why should he perpetrate this grim and sardonic joke?
 The sinners in the big city were left untouched. The godly folk in the little
 nearby village were punished by the evidences of God's wrath. How do the
 religious people interpret this calamity? Often and often they explain such
 calamities as flood, fire and storm by saying that God is angry at the sinful
 people and is warning them or destroying them for their sins. Was the
 hurricane in Bethany a sign of the love of God for his faithful worshipers?

 And God missed an even better chance, if there were a God who wished to punish
 rebels against his majesty and inscrutability. Just a few hundred miles north
 and east of Bethany, Okla., is Girard -- the home of The American Freeman: and
 The Debunker and The Joseph McCabe Magazine and the Little Blue Books -- the
 center of American free thought where an enormous stream of atheistic
 literature and. godless modern knowledge pours forth to enlighten  the masses.
 If there were a God directing hurricanes and he wanted to really "get" an
 uncompromising foe, whom he has no chance of persuading in the ordinary way,
 it would have been a devastating stroke for him to send his howling punitive
 blasts through the town of Girard. It would be a more remarkable suggestion
 of the avenging act of a God if only the Haldeman-Julius plant were destroyed

 wish the Christian and respectable, people of Girard nor those who are
 respectable and not so Christian nor those who are Christian and not exactly
 respectable to suffer from our proximity and our propaganda of atheism.

 and demons, flying familiarly, yet skittishly through the air, and that belief
 caused untold distress and pain and tragedy. The most holy Catholic church
 (and, after it, the various Protestant sects) enforced the dogma that heresy
 was terribly sinful and punishable by death. Imagine -- but all you need do
 is to recount -- the suffering entailed by that belief.

 When one surveys the causes and consequences of credulity, it is apparent
 that this easy believer in the impossible, this readiness toward false and
 fanatical notions, has been indeed a most serious and major crime against
 humanity. The social life in any age, it may be said, is about what its extent
 of credulity guarantees. In an extremely credulous age, social life will be
 cruel and dark and treacherous. in a skeptical age, social life will be more
 humane. We assert that the philosophy of humanity -- that the best interests
 of the human race -- demand a strong statement and a repeated, enlightening
 statement of atheism."

"Is God fair? The Christians say that God damns forever anyone who is skeptical
 about truth of bunkistic religion as revealed unto the holy haranguers.  What
 this means is that a God, if any, punishes a man for using his reason.

 If there is a God in existence, reasons should be available for his
 existence. Assuming that such a precious thing as a man's eternal future
 depends on his belief in a God, then the materials for that belief
 should be overwhelming and not at all doubtful.

 Yet here is a man whose reason makes it impossible for him to believe in
 a God. He sees no evidence of such an entity. He finds all the arguments
 weak and worthless. He doubts and he denies.

 Then is a God fair in visiting upon such a skeptic the penalty for his
 inevitable intellectual attitude? The intelligent man refuses to believe
 fairy tales. Can a God blame him? If so, then a God is not as fair as an
 ordinarily decent man. And fairness, we think, is more important than piety."

"Perhaps the most important advance in the behavioral sciences in our times
 has been the growing recognition that the perceiver is not just a passive
 camera taking a picture, but takes an active part in perception. He sees
 what experience has conditioned him to see. What perceiver then sees what
 is really there?  Nobody of course. Each of perceives what our past has
 prepared us to perceive. We select and distinguish, we focus on some objects
 and relationships and we blur others. We distort objective reality to make
 it conform to our needs our, or hopes, or fears, or hates, or envies or
 affections. Our eyes and brains do not merely register some objective
 portrait of other persons or groups but our very active scene is warped by
 what we have been taught to believe, by what we want to believe and by what
 we need to believe. It is impossible to reason a man out of something he
 has not been reasoned into. When people have acquired their beliefs on an
 emotional level they cannot be persuaded out of them on a rational level.
 No matter how strong the proof or the logic behind it, people will hold onto
 their emotional beliefs and twist the facts to meet their version of reality."

They told you to kneel but only to pray

All the wafers you can eat
And free treatment at the Paraclete *

 for them a superstition of the past.  They never took me to church.  And

 I got too interested in it....

 By the age of fifteen, I had convinced myself that nobody could give a
 reasonable explanation of what he meant by the word 'God' and that it was
 therefore as meaningless to assert a belief as to assert a disbelief in God.

 belief by displaying my lack of such belief, or even stating my lack of
 belief, if I was not challenged."

"A disturbing fact continues to surface in sex abuse research.  The first
 best predictor of abuse is alcohol or drug addiction in the father.  But
 the second best predictor is conservative religiosity, accompanied by
 parental belief in traditional male-female roles.  This means that if you
 want to know which children are most likely to be sexually abused by their
 father, the second most significant clue is *whether or not the parents
 belong to a conservative religious group with traditional role beliefs
 and rigid sexual attitudes*. (Brown and Bohn, 1989; Finkelhor, 1986; Fortune,
 1983; Goldstein et al, 1973; Van Leeuwen, 1990). (emphasis in original)

 CHORUS:

      In the glorious land above the sky (way up high)
      Work and pray, live on hay,
      You'll get pie in the sky when you die (that's a lie!)

 Oh the Starvation Army they play
 And they sing and they clap and they pray
 Till they get all your coin on the drum
 Then they tell you when you're on the bum:

 CHORUS

 Holy Rollers and jumpers come out
 And they roll and they jump and they shout
 Give your money to Jesus, they say
 He will cure all diseases today

 CHORUS

 If you fight hard for children and wife
 Try to get something good in this life
 You're a sinner and bad man, they tell
 When you die you will sure go to Hell

 CHORUS

 Working folks of all countries, unite!
 Side by side we for freedom will fight!
 When this world and its wealth we have gained,
 To the grafters we'll sing this refrain:

 LAST CHORUS:
      You will eat, by and by,
      When you've learned how to cook and to fry (and to fry!)
      Chop some wood, it'll do you good,

   "My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as
 a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by
 a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned
 men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer
 but as a fighter.
    In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage
 which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge
 to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific
 was his fight against the Jewish poison.
    Today, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more
 profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to
 shed his blood upon the Cross.
    As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have
 the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice...
    And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting
 rightly, it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have
 also a duty to my own people. And when I look on my people I see them work
 and work and toil and labor, and at the end of the week they have only
 for their wages wretchedness and misery.
    When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues

 answered three hundred years ago by Pascal. The unbeliever must act 'as
 though he believed, take holy water, have masses said etc. This will
 naturally cause you to believe and will besot you.' (Cela vous abetira--
 literally, will make you stupid.) We have to be made stupid, insist Professor
 Jacques Chevalier, defending his hero against the critics who have been
 shocked by Pascal's blunt language; we have to stultify our intelligence,
 because 'intellectual pride deprives us of God and debases us to the level of
 animals.' Which is, of course, perfectly true. But it does not follow from
 this truth that we ought to besot ourselves in the manner prescribed by
 Pascal and all the propagandists of all religions. Intellectual pride can
 be cured only by devaluating pretentious words, only by getting rid of
 conceptualized pseudo-knowledge and opening ourselves to reality. Artificial
 piety based on conditioned reflexes merely transfers intellectual pride from
 the bumptious individual to his even more bumptious Church. At one remove,
 the pride remains intact. For the convinced believer, understanding or direct
 contact with reality is exceedingly difficult. Moreover, the mere fact of
 having a strong reverential feeling about some hallowed thing, person or
 proposition is no guarantee of the existence of the thing, the infallibility

 admit that there is good ground for expressing definite convictions about

 into savagery. There are several answers to this assertion. One is that
 the bonds of human society were formed without the aid of their theology;
 and, in the opinion of not a few competent judges, have been weakened rather
 than strengthened by a good deal of it. Greek science, Greek art, the ethics
 of old Israel, the social organisation of old Rome, contrived to come into
 being, without the help of any one who believed in a single distinctive
 article of the simplest of the Christian creeds. The science, the art,
 the jurisprudence, the chief political and social theories, of the modern

"The doctrine that future happiness depends upon belief is monstrous. It is
 the infamy of infamies. The notion that faith in Christ is to be rewarded by
 an eternity of bliss, while a dependence upon reason, observation and
 experience merits everlasting pain, is too absurd for refutation, and can be
 relieved only by that unhappy mixture of insanity and ignorance, called
 "faith."  What man, who ever thinks, can believe that blood can appease God?
 And yet, our entire system of religion is based upon that believe. The Jews
 pacified Jehovah with the blood of animals, and according to the Christian
 system, the blood of Jesus softened the heart of God a little, and rendered
 possible the salvation of a fortunate few. It is hard to conceive how the
 human mind can give assent to such terrible ideas, or how any sane man can
 read the Bible and still believe in the doctrine of inspiration."

 mankind from eating the fruit thereof.  The priests have never ceased

 theology is the sworn enemy of philosophy, and the church with its flaming

"There is but one way to demonstrate the existence of a power independent of
 and superior to nature, and that is by breaking, if only for one moment, the
 continuity of cause and effect. Pluck from the endless chain of existence one
 little link; stop for one instant the grand procession and you have shown
 beyond all contradiction that nature has a master. Change the fact, just for
 one second, that matter attracts matter, and a god appears.

     The rudest savage has always known this fact, and for that reason always
 demanded the evidence of miracle.  The founder of a religion must be able to
 turn water into wine -- cure with a word the blind and lame, and raise with a
 simple touch the dead to life. It was necessary for him to demonstrate to the
 satisfaction of his barbarian disciple, that he was superior to nature. In
 times of ignorance this was easy to do. The credulity of the savage was
 almost boundless. To him the marvelous was the beautiful, the mysterious was
 the sublime. Consequently, every religion has for its foundation a miracle --
 that is to say, a violation of nature -- that is to say, a falsehood.

     No one, in the world's whole history, ever attempted to substantiate a
 truth by a miracle. Truth scorns the assistance of miracle. Nothing but
 falsehood ever attested itself by signs and wonders. No miracle ever was
 performed, and no sane man ever thought he had performed one, and until one
 is performed, there can be no evidence of the existence of any power superior
 to, and independent of nature.

     The church wishes us to believe. Let the church, or one of its
 intellectual saints, perform a miracle, and we will believe. We are told
 that nature has a superior. Let this superior, for one single instant,
 control nature, and we will admit the truth of your assertions."

 sense -- admits, not only, that she cannot perform a miracle but insists

 power has decreased. The intellectual advancement of man depends upon how
 often he can exchange an old superstition for a new truth. The church never
 enabled a human being to make even one of these exchanges; on the contrary,
 all her power has been used to prevent them. In spite, however, of the church,
 man found that some of his religious conceptions were wrong. By reading his
 Bible, he found that the ideas of his God were more cruel and brutal than
 those of the most depraved savage. He also discovered that this holy book was
 filled with ignorance, and that it must have been written by persons wholly
 unacquainted with the nature of the phenomena by which we are surrounded; and
 now and then, some man had the goodness and courage to speak his honest
 thoughts. In every age some thinker, some doubter, some investigator, some
 hater of hypocrisy, some despiser of sham, some brave lover of the right,
 has gladly, proudly and heroically braved the ignorant fury of superstition
 for the sake of man and truth. These divine men were generally torn in pieces

 reverence for some of the deities. Christ was crucified by a religious rabble

 -free to investigate, to guess and dream and hope
 -free to judge and determine for myself
 -free to reject all ignorant and cruel creeds, all the "inspired" books
  that savages have produced, and all the barbarous legends of the past
 -free from popes and priests
 -free from all the "called" and "set apart"
 -free from sanctified mistakes and holy lies
 -free from the fear of eternal pain
 -free from the winged monsters of night
 -free from devils, ghosts, and gods
   For the first time I was free. There were no prohibited places in all
 the realms of my thought-no air, no space, where fancy could not spread
 her painted wings
 -no chains for my limbs
 -no lashes for my back
 -no fires for my flesh
 -no master's frown or threat
 -no following another's steps
 -no need to bow, or cringe, or crawl, or utter lying words.
   I was free. I stood erect and fearlessly, joyously, faced all worlds.

 went out in love to all the heroes, the thinkers who gave their lives
 for the liberty of hand and brain
 -for the freedom of labor and thought
 -to those who fell on the fierce fields of war, to those who died in
  dungeons bound with chains

 -to those whose bones were crushed, whose flesh was scarred and torn

"No human being has imagination enough to conceive of this infinite horror.

 All that the human race has suffered in war and want, in pestilence and
 famine, in fire and flood -- all the pangs and pains of every disease and
 every death -- all of this is nothing compared with the agonies to be
 endured by one lost soul.

 This is the consolation of the Christian religion. This is the justice
 of God -- the mercy of Christ.

 This frightful dogma, this infinite lie, made me the implacable enemy of
 Christianity. The truth is that this belief in eternal pain has been the real
 persecutor. It founded the Inquisition, forged the chains, and furnished the
 fagots. It has darkened the lives of many millions. It made the cradle as
 terrible as the coffin. It enslaved nations and shed the blood of countless
 thousands. It sacrificed the wisest, the bravest and the best. It subverted
 the idea of justice, drove mercy from the heart, changed men to fiends and
 banished reason from the brain.

 Like a venomous serpent it crawls and coils and hisses in every orthodox
 creed.

 It makes man an eternal victim and God an eternal fiend. It is the one
 infinite horror. Every church in which it is taught is a public curse. Every
 preacher who teaches it is an enemy of mankind. Below this Christian dogma,
 savagery cannot go. It is the infinite of malice, hatred, and revenge.

 Nothing could add to the horror of hell, except the presence of its
 creator, God.

 While I have life, as long as I draw breath, I shall deny with all my
 strength, and hate with every drop of my blood, this infinite lie."

"Christianity teaches that all offences can be forgiven. Every church
 unconsciously allows people to commit crimes on credit. On the other hand,
 what is called infidelity says: There is no being in the universe who rewards,
 and there is no being who punishes -- every act has its consequences. If the
 act is good, the consequences are good; if the act is bad, the consequences
 are bad; and these consequences must be borne by the actor. It says to every
 human being: You must reap what you sow. There is no reward, there is no
 punishment, but there are consequences, and these consequences are the
 invisible and implacable police of nature. They cannot be avoided. They
 cannot be bribed. No power can awe them, and there is not gold enough in the
 world to make them pause. Even a God cannot induce them to release for one
 instant their victim.

 This great truth is, in my judgment, the gospel of morality. If all men knew
 that they must inevitably bear the consequences of their own actions -- if
 they absolutely knew that they could not injure another without injuring
 themselves, the world, in my judgment, would be far better than it is."

"Rome was far better when Pagan than when Catholic. It was better to allow
 gladiators and criminals to fight than to burn honest men. The greatest of
 the Romans denounced the cruelties of the arena. Seneca condemned the combats
 even of wild beasts. He was tender enough to say that "we should have a bond
 of sympathy for all sentient beings, knowing that only the depraved and base
 take pleasure in the sight of blood and suffering." Aurelius compelled the
 gladiators to fight with blunted swords. Roman lawyers declared that all men
 are by nature free and equal. Woman, under Pagan rule in Rome, became as free
 as man. Zeno, long before the birth of Christ, taught that virtue alone
 establishes a difference between men. We know that the Civil Law is the
 foundation of our codes. We know that fragments of Greek and Roman art --
 a few manuscripts saved from Christian destruction, some inventions and
 discoveries of the Moors -- were the seeds of modern civilization.
 Christianity, for a thousand years, taught memory to forget and reason to
 believe. Not one step was taken in advance. Over the manuscripts of
 philosophers and poets, priests with their ignorant tongues thrust out,
 devoutly scrawled the forgeries of faith. For a thousand years the torch of
 progress was extinguished in the blood of Christ, and his disciples, moved
 by ignorant zeal, by insane, cruel creeds, destroyed with flame and sword a
 hundred million of their fellow-men. They made this world a hell. But if
 cathedrals had been universities -- if dungeons of the Inquisition had been
 laboratories -- if Christians had believed in character instead of creed --
 if they had taken from the Bible all the good and thrown away the wicked and
 absurd -- if domes of temples had been observatories -- if priests had been
 philosophers -- if missionaries had taught the useful arts -- if astrology
 had been astronomy -- if the black art had been chemistry -- if superstition
 had been science -- if religion had been humanity -- it would have been a
 heaven filled with love, with liberty and joy."

"Science is the enemy of fear and credulity. It invites investigation,
 challenges the reason, stimulates inquiry, and welcomes the unbeliever. It
 seeks to give food and shelter, and raiment, education and liberty to the
 human race. It welcomes every fact and every truth. It has furnished a
 foundation of morals, a philosophy for the guidance of man. From all books
 it selects the good, and from all theories, the true. It seeks to civilize
 the human race by the cultivation of the intellect and heart. It refines,
 through art, music and the drama -- giving voice and expression to every
 noble thought. The mysterious does not excite the feeling of worship, but
 the ambition to understand. It does not pray -- it works. It does not answer
 inquiry with the malicious cry of "blasphemy." Its feelings are not hurt by
 contradiction, neither does it ask to be protected by law from the laughter
 of heretics. It has taught man that he cannot walk beyond the horizon -- that
 the questions of origin and destiny cannot be answered -- they an infinite
 personality cannot be comprehended by a finite being, and that the truth of
 any system of religion based on the supernatural cannot by any possibility
 be established -- such a religion not being within the domain of evidence.
 And, above all, it teaches that all our duties are here -- that all our
 obligations are to sentient beings; that intelligence, guided by kindness,
 is the highest possible wisdom; and that "man believes not what he would,
 but what he can."

 who ever touched this globe. He has explained more of the phenomena of life
 than all of the religious teachers. Write the name of Charles Darwin on the
 one hand and the name of every theologian who ever lived on the other, and
 from that name has come more light to the world than from all of those. His
 doctrine of evolution, his doctrine of the survival of the fittest, his
 doctrine of the origin of species, has removed in every thinking mind the
 last vestige of orthodox Christianity. He has not only stated, but he has
 demonstrated, that the inspired writer knew nothing of this world, nothing
 of the origin of man, nothing of geology, nothing of astronomy, nothing of
 nature; that the Bible is a book written by ignorance -- at the instigation
 of fear. Think of the men who replied to him. Only a few years ago there
 was no person too ignorant to successfully answer Charles Darwin; and the

"If there is a God, it is reasonably certain that he made the world, but it
 is by no means certain that he is the author of the Bible. Why then should
 we not place greater confidence in Nature than in a book? And even if this
 God made not only the world but the book besides, it does not follow that
 the book is the best part of creation, and the only part that we will be
 eternally punished for denying. It seems to me that it is quite as important
 to know something of the solar system, something of the physical history of
 this globe, as it is to know the adventures of Jonah or the diet of Ezekiel.
 For my part, I would infinitely prefer to know all the results of scientific
 investigation, than to be inspired as Moses was. Supposing the Bible to be
 true; why is it any worse or more wicked for Freethinkers to deny it, than
 for priests to deny the doctrine of evolution, or the dynamic theory of heat?
 Why should we be damned for laughing at Samson and his foxes, while others,
 holding the Nebular Hypothesis in utter contempt, go straight to heaven? It
 seems to me that a belief in the great truths of science are fully as
 essential to salvation, as the creed of any church. We are taught that a man
 may be perfectly acceptable to God even if he denies the rotundity of the
 earth, the Copernican system, the three laws of Kepler, the indestructibility
 of matter and the attraction of gravitation. And we are also taught that a

"We have already compared the benefits of theology and science. When the
 theologian governed the world, it was covered with huts and hovels for the

 reading and writing were unknown arts. The poor were clad in rags and skins
 -- they devoured crusts, and gnawed bones. The day of Science dawned, and
 the luxuries of a century ago are the necessities of to-day. Men in the
 middle ranks of life have more of the conveniences and elegancies than the
 princes and kings of the theological times. But above and over all this, is
 the development of mind. There is more of value in the brain of an average
 man of to-day -- of a master-mechanic, of a chemist, of a naturalist, of an
 inventor, than there was in the brain of the world four hundred years ago.

 These blessings did not fall from the skies. These benefits did not drop
 from the outstretched hands of priests. They were not found in cathedrals or
 behind altars -- neither were they searched for with holy candles. They were
 not discovered by the closed eyes of prayer, nor did they come in answer to
 superstitious supplication. They are the children of freedom, the gifts of

"[T]he effect of the religious freedom Amendment to our Constitution was to
 take every form of propagation of religion out of the realm of things
 which could directly or indirectly be made public business, and thereby be
 supported in whole or in part at taxpayers' expense. That is a difference
 which the Constitution sets up between religion and almost every other
 subject matter of legislation, a difference which goes to the very root of
 religious freedom[...] This freedom was first in the Bill of Rights because
 it was first in the forefathers' minds; it was set forth in absolute terms,
 and its strength is its rigidity. It was intended not only to keep the
 states' hands out of religion, but to keep religion's hands off the state,
 and, above all, to keep bitter religious controversy out of public life by
 denying to every denomination any advantage from getting control of public
 policy or the public purse."

"[The Establishment Clause and Religious Freedom Clause] of our Federal
 Constitution ha[ve] never been wholly pleasing to most religious groups.
 They are all quick to invoke its protections; they are all irked when they
 feel its restraints. This Court has gone a long way, if not an unreasonable
 way, to hold that public business of paramount importance as maintenance of
 public order, protection of the privacy of a home, and taxation may not be
 pursued by a state in a way that even indirectly will interfere with
 religious proselyting.[...]  But we cannot have it both ways.  Religious
 teaching cannot be a private affair when the state seeks to impose
 regulations which infringe on it indirectly, and a public affair when it
 comes to taxing citizens of one faith to aid another, or those of no faith
 to aid all. If these principles seem harsh in prohibiting aid to Catholic
 education, it must not be forgotten that it is the same Constitution that
 alone assures Catholics the right to maintain these schools at all when
 predominant local sentiment would forbid them. [...] Nor should I think
 that those who have done so well without this aid would want to see this
 separation between Church and State broken down.  If the state may aid
 these religious schools, it may therefore regulate them. Many groups have
 sought aid from tax funds, only to find that it carried political controls
 with it. Indeed, this Court has declared that 'It is hardly lack of due
 process for the Government to regulate that which it subsidizes.'

"Human beings cannot be morally responsible to God. If we blame a person for
 an evil act, we thereby imply that he was to some extent evil prior to his
 action. For to say that a person is responsible for an evil action is to say
 he caused it because he was evil. But how did he become evil? It he made
 himself evil, then this would be an evil act and would--if he were responsible
 for it--imply that he was already evil. It follows that the evil of a person
 must precede the act of making himself evil. Therefore this individual cannot
 ultimately be the responsible source of his own evil. Then who is? It cannot
 be Satan, for the same argument would apply to him. It must be God, for he
 created everything. Therefore God is ultimately responsible for all evil."

"It is sometimes argued that we have a fifty-fifty betting proposition when
 considering God's existence or nonexistence. If we bet that God exists and
 he does exist, then we lose nothing while possibly gaining salvation. If we
 bet that God exist and he does not exist, then we lose nothing. But if we
 bet that God does not exist and he does exist, then we lose everything. Of
 course, if we bet that God does not exist and we are correct, then we lose
 nothing. Therefore it is prudent to bet on God. (This is Pascal`s Wager).
    The problem with the above argument is that it does not establish a
 fifty-fifty betting proposition. There are many alternatives that it fails
 to consider. For example, God may exist but he may damn anyone who "bets" on
 his existence merely for reasons of prudence. He may consider such a "bet"
 to be an insult. Furthermore, it may be that a mere belief in God is not
 enough to ensure salvation. A further requirement may be the belief in a
 particular religion. But which religion? Again, there are many alternatives.
 Another possible alternative is that God offers salvation only to atheist
 because God does not like being surrounded by obsequious "yes-men." God may
 prize independence and skepticism."

"The analogy between the God of popular Roman Catholicism and a cruel Caesar
 is striking:  one must serve him in every way and praise him all but
 continually; those who displease him are given over to eternal torture; he
 cannot be approached directly even with petitions; the best procedure is to
 ask somebody who has found favor-a saint, and a particular one depending on
 the nature of one's case-to intercede with the mother of his son, in the hope
 that she may take up the matter with her son, and the son with the father."

"Christianity preaches that love is divine and points to Jesus as the
 incarnation of love: but a Buddhist, and not only a Buddhist, might well say
 that the sacrifice of a few hours' crucifixion followed by everlasting bliss
 at the right hand of God in heaven, while millions are suffering eternal
 tortures in hell, is hardly the best possible symbol of love and self-
 sacrifice. The boss's son who works briefly at lower jobs before he joins his
 father at the head of the company would hardly reconcile the workers to their
 fate if they should be tormented bitterly without relief. Of course, some
 Christians have felt this strongly and it has troubled them deeply, but the
 dominate note in the New Testament and ever since has been one of astounding
 callousness."

"As long as we cling to the conception of hell, God is not love in any human
 sense-and least of all, love in the human sense raised to the highest potency

 looses meaning. The significance of salvation depends on an alternative, and
 in traditional Christianity this alternative is eternal torment."

"Few Christians would be in doubt what to think of a father tortured his
 children for forty-eight hours because they did not agree with him or did

 few of them a single chance while offering the vast majority no opportunity
 at all to know his will, most people would consider this the epitome of an
 inhuman lack of love and justice. The God of traditional Christianity,

 eternal torment."

"Consider the justice of the God of St. Augustine-and by no means only
 St. Augustine. All men deserve damnation, but God elects a few for salvation.
 They do not deserve this: the grace of God would not by gratia if it were not

 receives a worse lot than he deserves, only some receive a better lot, and
 this shows God's infinite mercy.

 of a teacher who gave a test that everybody failed and then nevertheless gave
 a few of his students "excellent," justifying his procedure along the lines
 suggested by Augustine. This is precisely what we mean by injustice."

 not depend on his own efforts or his conduct, and that God lets our eternal
 bliss or torment hinge, at least in large part, on the efficiency of one or
 another organization. A human judge acting in analogous fashion would be

After [Benjamin] Franklin came a herd of Electrical Pioneers whose names
have become part of our electrical terminology: Myron Volt, Mary Louise Amp,
James Watt, Bob Transformer, etc.  These pioneers conducted many important
electrical experiments.  For example, in 1780 Luigi Galvani discovered (this
is the truth) that when he attached two different kinds of metal to the leg
of a frog, an electrical current developed and the frog's leg kicked, even
though it was no longer attached to the frog, which was dead anyway.
Galvani's discovery led to enormous advances in the field of amphibian
medicine.  Today, skilled veterinary surgeons can take a frog that has been
seriously injured or killed, implant pieces of metal in its muscles, and
watch it hop back into the pond just like a normal frog, except for the fact
that it sinks like a stone.

And so, men, we can see that human skin is an even more complex and

undergo a painful surgical procedure wherein your skin is turned inside-out,
so the young cells are on the outside, but then of course you have the
unpleasant side effect that your insides gradually fill up with dead old
cells and you explode.  So this procedure is pretty much limited to top

Harris had the beefsteak pie between his knees, and was carving it, and George
and I were waiting with our plates ready.
	"Have you got a spoon there?" says Harris; "I want a spoon to help
the gravy with."
	The hamper was close behind us, and George and I both turned round to
reach one out.  We were not five seconds getting it.  When we looked round
again, Harris and the pie were gone!
	It was a wide, open field.  There was not a tree or a bit of hedge for 
hundreds of yards.  He could not have tumbled into the river, because we were
on the water side of him, and he would have had to climb over us to do it.
	George and I gazed all about.  Then we gazed at each other.
	"Has he been snatched up to heaven?" I queried.
	"They'd hardly have taken the pie, too," said George.
	There seemed weight in this objection, and we discarded the heavenly
theory.
	"I suppose the truth of the matter is," suggested George, descending
to the commonplace and practicable, "that there has been an earthquake."
	And then he added, with a touch of sadness in his voice: "I wish he
hadn't been carving that pie."

Harry and Fred were playing their Sunday afternoon golf game.  The game, as
always, was close.  They were at the treacherous 12th hole: a par three that
required a perfect first shot over a large pond and onto a tiny green.  There
were sand traps on the other three sides of the green, and a small road 50
feet beyond it.  Harry went first.  He carefully addressed the ball and hit
a good shot that landed just on the edge of the green, narrowly avoiding the
pond.  Just as Fred addressed his ball, he looked up and noticed a funeral
procession along the road just behind the green.  Fred put down his club,
took his hat off, and waited for the entire procession to pass.  As soon as
the cars were gone he put his hat back on and started addressing the ball
again.  Harry said, "Damn, Fred.  That was a really nice thing you did,
waiting for the funeral to pass like that."
	Fred finished his swing, making perfect contact with the ball.  It
was an excellent shot that landed 7 feet from the hole.  "It's the least I
could do," he said, smiling at his shot, "We were married for 22 years,
you know."

	Harry, a golfing enthusiast if there ever was one, arrived home 
from the club to an irate, ranting wife.
	"I'm leaving you, Harry," his wife announced bitterly.  "You
promised me faithfully that you'd be back before six and here it is almost
nine.  It just can't take that long to play 18 holes of golf."
	"Honey, wait," said Harry.  "Let me explain.  I know what I promised
you, but I have a very good reason for being late.  Fred and I tee'd off
right on time and everything was find for the first three holes.  Then, on
the fourth tee Fred had a stroke.  I ran back to the clubhouse but couldn't
find a doctor.  And, by the time I got back to Fred, he was dead.  So, for
the next 15 holes, it was hit the ball, drag Fred, hit the ball, drag Fred...

	He had been bitten by a dog, but didn't give it much thought
until he noticed that the wound was taking a remarkably long time to
heal.  Finally, he consulted a doctor who took one look at it and
ordered the dog brought in.  Just as he had suspected, the dog had
rabies.  Since it was too late to give the patient serum, the doctor
felt he had to prepare him for the worst.  The poor man sat down at the
doctor's desk and began to write.  His physician tried to comfort him.
"Perhaps it won't be so bad," he said. "You needn't make out your will
right now."

I braved the contempt of my friends last week and ventured out to see
Bambi, the Disney rerelease that is proving to be a hit once again in the
box office.  I was looking forward to a gentle, soothing, late afternoon
relief from the Washington Summer.  Instead I was traumatized.  As a
psycho-sexual return to the horrors of early adolescence, it couldn't be
more effective.  For the first half-hour, you're lulled into an agreeable
sense of security and comfort.  Birds twitter; small rabbits turn out to
be great conversationalists.  Pop is what Senator Moynihan would describe
as an absent father, but Mom's there to make you feel OK in the odd
thunderstorm.  You make great friends, fool around on the ice, discover
the meadow, generally mellow out.  Then, without any particular warning,
your mom gets shot, your voice breaks, huge growths start appearing on
your head, and your peers start heading off into the clover with the
apparent intention of having sex.  Next thing you know, the forest burns
down. If I were still eight, I think I'd prefer Rambo III.

It was a warm, sunny Sunday, and a man and his wife decided to take in the zoo.

It was on the tip of my tongue to tell them about the deer, but I ended up
not doing it.  That was one thing I kept to myself.  I've never spoken or
written of it until just now, today.  And I have to tell you that it seems
a lesser thing written down, damn near inconsequential.  But for me it was
the best part of that trip, the cleanest part, and it was a moment I found
myself returning to, almost helplessly, when there was trouble in my life --
my first day in the bush in Vietnam, and this fellow walked into the clearing
where we were with his hand over his nose and when he took his hand away there
was no nose there because it had been shot off; the time the doctor told us
our youngest son might be hydrocephalic (he turned out just to have an
oversized head, thank God); the long crazy weeks before my mother died.  I
would find my thoughts turning back to that morning, the scuffed suede of
her ears, the white flash of her tail.  But eight hundred million Red Chinese

Long, long ago, in the Old West, a rancher rode into town to buy supplies.
When he returned, he found that his whole family had been killed, his wife
raped, his house burned, and all his cattle rustled.  When he told his
distant neighbors about the tragedy, a few of them reported that the only
stranger they had seen in the area for weeks was a tall desperado wearing a
black hat and a red neckerchief.
	The cowboy saddled his fastest horse and set out to find the villian.
He searched for months but couldn't catch up with the culprit; in town after
dusty town he was told that a man fitting the description had been there but
had just departed; usually after some heinous crime.
	One evening after a hard day's ride he came into a town, tied his
horse, and entered the saloon.  At a table in the corner sat an ugly man,
with a black hat and a red neckerchief!  Slowly the cowboy stalked up to
this man, his hands resting upon his guns.
	"Are you the man who killed my family, raped my wife, burned my
house and rustled my cattle?"
	"Probably; after so many, how can I be sure?" snarled the bandit.

Many lower life forms demonstrate qualities that, at first, just don't
seem survival oriented.  For instance, the female praying mantis, after mating
with, well, her mate, will devour him.  For the male praying mantis, however,
it's a catch-22.  If he mates, he gets screwed out of an opportunity to mate
again.  If he doesn't mate, he doesn't reproduce, ending his family tree.  This
suicidal behavior is commonly called the Preying Mantis Syndrome -- and many
life forms are periodically subject to its wrath.  How did the preying mantis
become stuck in such a awful, vicious cycle?  This is probably what happened:
	The male mantis arrives at the residence of the female mantis.  After
some courtship exercises (dinner, a movie, inserting the diaphram) they mate.
The female mantis, her lust for... lust being satisfied, relaxes while the
male raids the refrigerator and returns home.  This behavior continues until
the male and female (mantissas?) establish a permanent relationship.  Then the
male establishes a new pattern of behavior:  Football on Mondays, baseball on
Tuesdays, happy hour on Wednesdays, uh, well, uh, working-late-at-the-office
on Thursdays, etc. etc.  The female tolerates this for awhile, then files for
a divorce.  After a long court battle, she concludes one thing:  It simplifies
matters tremendously to just eat him when you're done with him.
	Well, through the centuries of evolution, the Preying Mantis Syndrome
has been carried up to the highest life forms, as well as to humans.  That is
why, one week out of every month, the female of the species will feel compelled
to bite the head off of the male.  The Syndrome is inescapable, but when it
occurs in the female of our species, it's best to just avoid them for a while.

... Now you're ready for the actual shopping.  Your goal should be to get it
over with as quickly as possible, because the longer you stay in the mall,
the longer your children will have to listen to holiday songs on the mall
public-address system, and many of these songs can damage children
emotionally.  For example: "Frosty the Snowman" is about a snowman who
befriends some children, plays with them until they learn to love him, then
melts.  And "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" is about a young reindeer who,
because of a physical deformity, is treated as an outcast by the other
reindeer.  Then along comes good, old Santa.  Does he ignore the deformity?
Does he look past Rudolph's nose and respect Rudolph for the sensitive
reindeer he is underneath?  No.  Santa asks Rudolph to guide his sleigh, as
if Rudolph were nothing more than some kind of headlight with legs and a
tail.  So unless you want your children exposed to this kind of
insensitivity, you should shop quickly.

	On the occasion of Nero's 25th birthday, he arrived at the Colosseum 
to find that the Praetorian Guard had prepared a treat for him in the arena.  
There stood 25 naked virgins, like candles on a cake, tied to poles, burning 
alive.  "Wonderful!" exclaimed the deranged emperor, "but one of them isn't 
dead yet.  I can see her lips moving.  Go quickly and find out what she is 
saying."
	The centurion saluted, and hurried out to the virgin, getting as near
the flames as he dared, and listened intently.  Then he turned and ran back
to the imperial box.  "She is not talking," he reported to Nero, "she is

	Once again we find ourselves enmeshed in The Holiday Season, that very
special time of year when we join with our loved ones in sharing centuries-old
traditions such as trying to find a parking space at the mall.  We
traditionally do this in my family by driving around the parking lot until we
see a shopper emerge from the mall.  Then we follow her, in very much the same
spirit as the Three Wise Men, who, 2,000 years ago, followed a star, week after
week, until it led them to a parking space.
	We try to keep our bumper about 4 inches from the shopper's calves, to
let the other circling cars know that she belongs to us.  Sometimes, two cars
will get into a fight over whom the shopper belongs to, similar to the way
great white sharks will fight over who gets to eat a snorkeler.  So, we follow
our shopper closely, hunched over the steering wheel, whistling "It's Beginning
to Look a Lot Like Christmas" through our teeth, until we arrive at her car,
which is usually parked several time zones away from the mall.  Sometimes our
shopper tries to indicate she was merely planning to drop off some packages and
go back to shopping.  But, when she hears our engine rev in a festive fashion
and sees the holiday gleam in our eyes, she realizes she would never make it.

	Once upon a time, there was a fisherman who lived by a great river.
One day, after a hard day's fishing, he hooked what seemed to him to be the
biggest, strongest fish he had ever caught.  He fought with it for hours,
until, finally, he managed to bring it to the surface.  Looking of the edge
of the boat, he saw the head of this huge fish breaking the surface.  Smiling
with pride, he reached over the edge to pull the fish up.  Unfortunately, he
accidently caught his watch on the edge, and, before he knew it, there was a
snap, and his watch tumbled into the water next to the fish with a loud
"sploosh!"  Distracted by this shiny object, the fish made a sudden lunge,
simultaneously snapping the line, and swallowing the watch.  Sadly, the
fisherman stared into the water, and then began the slow trip back home.
	Many years later, the fisherman, now an old man, was working in a
boring assembly-line job in a large city.  He worked in a fish-processing
plant.  It was his job, as each fish passed under his hands, to chop off their
heads, readying them for the next phase in processing.  This monotonous task
went on for years, the dull *thud* of the cleaver chopping of each head being
his entire world, day after day, week after weary week.  Well, one day, as he
was chopping fish, he happened to notice that the fish coming towards him on
the line looked very familiar.  Yes, yes, it looked... could it be the fish
he had lost on that day so many years ago?  He trembled with anticipation as
his cleaver came down.  IT STRUCK SOMETHING HARD!  IT WAS HIS THUMB!

	Once upon a time, there were five blind men who had the opportunity
to experience an elephant for the first time.  One approached the elephant,
and, upon encountering one of its sturdy legs, stated, "Ah, an elephant is
like a tree."  The second, after exploring the trunk, said, "No, an elephant
is like a strong hose."  The third, grasping the tail, said "Fool!  An elephant
is like a rope!"  The fourth, holding an ear, stated, "No, more like a fan."
And the fifth, leaning against the animal's side, said, "An elephant is like
a wall."  The five then began to argue loudly about who had the more accurate
perception of the elephant.
	The elephant, tiring of all this abuse, suddenly reared up and
attacked the men.  He continued to trample them until they were nothing but
bloody lumps of flesh.  Then, strolling away, the elephant remarked, "It just
goes to show that you can't depend on first impressions.  When I first saw
them I didn't think they they'd be any fun at all."

Readers Ask:
	Is it possible to kill a vampire with a gun?

Vampires are a source of great irritation to the average homeowner and it is
usually to one's advantage to remove these pests as rapidly as possible.  If
a professional exterminater specializing in the undead is unavailable, it is
possible to handle the situation with common household items.  However, much
of the common folklore of vanquishing the undead needs clarifying.  First,
driving a sharpened Louisville Slugger through a vampire's heart will NOT kill
it.  Since it's not quite alive, why would the heart be any different than
puncturing it in the, for example, left buttock?  Stake driving should be
avoided at any cost since its effect will be to terribly annoy the vampire,
and the last thing you want on your hands is an irate Lord of Darkness.
Handguns are also a definite no-no.  Common sense indicates that it requires
more to defeat an incarnation of evil than hurling lumps of lead or silver
through its body.  One time-honored method is to expose the vampire to the
sun, sever its head (any power saw should be sufficient), fill its mouth with
holy wafers (vanilla wafers over which the Lord's prayer has been read will
do in a pinch), immerse the head in an urn filled with holy water, place the
urn in consecrated lands and bury the rest of the body underneath a crossroad
(i.e. the intersection of Broad & Chestnut).  Sure, it's a lot of work.  But
you'll never have to worry about those damn bats pestering the neighbors again.

		Safety Tips for the Post-Nuclear Existence
		  Tip #1: How to tell when you are dead.

	(1) Little things start bothering you: little things like worms,
	    bugs, ants.
	(2) Something is missing in your personal relationships.
	(3) Your dog becomes overly affectionate.
	(4) You have a hard time getting a waiter.
	(5) Exotic birds flock around you.
	(6) People ignore you at parties.
	(7) You have a hard time getting up in the morning.
	(8) You no longer get off on cocaine.

		Safety Tips for the Post-Nuclear Existence

	(1)  Never use an elevator in a building that has been hit by a nuclear
	     bomb; use the stairs.
	(2)  When you're flying through the air, remember to roll when you hit
	     the ground.
	(3)  If you're on fire, avoid gasoline and other flammable materials.
	(4)  Don't attempt communication with dead people; it will only lead to
	     psychological problems.
	(5)  Food will be scarce; you will have to scavenge.  Learn to
	     recognize foods that will be available after the bomb: mashed
	     potatoes, shredded wheat, tossed salad, ground beef, etc.
	(6)  Put your hand over your mouth when you sneeze; internal organs
	     will be scarce in the post-nuclear age.
	(7)  Try to be neat; fall only in designated piles.
	(8)  Drive carefully in "Heavy Fallout" areas; people could be
	     staggering illegally.
	(9)  Nutritionally, hundred dollar bills are equal to ones, but more
	     sanitary due to limited circulation.
	(10) Accumulate mannequins now; spare parts will be in short supply on
	     D-Day.

	Sam went to his psychiatrist complaining of a hatred for elephants.
"I can't stand elephants," he explained.  "I lie awake nights despising
them.  The thought of an elephant fills me with loathing."
	"Sam," said the psychiatrist, "there's only one thing for you to do.  
Go to Africa, organize a safari, find an elephant in the jungle and shoot it.
That way you'll get it out of your system."
	Sam immediately made arrangements for a safari hunt in Africa,
inviting his best friend to join him.   They arrived in Nairobi and lost no
time getting out on the jungle trails.  After they had been hunting for
several days, Sam's best friend grabbed him by the arm one morning and
yelled at him:
	"Sam, Sam, Sam!  Over there behind that tree there's and elephant!
Sam -- Get your gun -- no, no, not THAT gun -- the rifle with the longer 
barrel!  Now aim it!  QUICK!  SAM!  QUICK!  No!  Not that way -- this way!
Be sure you don't jerk the trigger!  Wait SAM!  Don't let him see you!  Aim
at his head!"
	Sam whirled around, took aim, and killed his friend.  He was put in
prison and his psychiatrist flew to Africa to visit him.  "I sent you over
here to kill and elephant and instead you shoot your best friend," the 
psychiatrist said.  "Why?"
	"Well," Sam replied, "there's only one thing in the world that I
hate more than elephants and that is a loudmouth know-it-all!"

... So the documentary-makers stick with sharks.  Generally, their procedure
is to scatter bleeding fish pieces around their boat, so as to infest the
waters.  I would estimate that the primary food source of sharks today is
bleeding fish pieces scattered by people making documentaries.  Once the
sharks arrive, they are generally fairly listless.  The general shark
attitude seems to be: "Oh God, another documentary." So the divers have to
somehow goad them into attacking, under the guise of Scientific Research.
"We know very little about the effect of electricity on sharks," the
narrator will say, in a deeply scientific voice.  "That is why Todd is going
to jab this Great White in the testicles with a cattle prod." The divers
keep this kind of thing up until the shark finally gets irritated and snaps
at them, and then they act as though this was a totally unexpected and very
dangerous development, although clearly it is what they wanted all along.

The first Great Steward, Parrafin the Climber, was employed in King
Chloroplast's kitchen as second scullery boy when the old King met a tragic
death.  He apparently fell backward by accident on a dozen salad forks.
Simultaneously the true heir, his son Carotene, mysteriously fled the city,
complaining of some sort of plot and a lot of threatening notes left on his
breakfast tray.  At the time, this looked suspicious what with his father's
death, and Carotene was suspected of foul play.  Then the rest of the King's
relatives began to drop dead one after the other in an odd fashion.  Some
were found strangled with dishrags and some succumbed to food poisoning.  A
few were found drowned in the soup vats, and one was attacked by assailants
unknown and beaten to death with a pot roast.  At least three appear to have
thrown themselves backward on salad forks, perhaps in a noble gesture of
grief over the King's untimely end.  Finally there was no one left in Minas
Troney who was either eligible or willing to wear the accursed crown, and
the rule of Twodor was up for grabs.  The scullery slave Parrafin bravely
accepted the Stewardship of Twodor until that day when a lineal descendant
of Carotene's returns to reclaim his rightful throne, conquer Twodor's
enemies, and revamp the postal system.

	"Basically, what we do is band together to exchange information

country.  We're completely computerized.

leads as possible.  We'll tell some twenty-three-year-old loser that his
real parents can be found at a certain address on the other side of the
country.  Well, by the time the kid shows up, the family is prepared.  They
look over the kid's photos and information and they say, 'Oh, the Emersons...
yeah, they used to live here... I think they moved out about five years ago.
I think they went to Iowa, or maybe Idaho.'
	"Bam, the door shuts in the kid's face and he's back to zero again.  
He's got nothing to go on but the orphan's pathetic determination to continue.

	This guy is walking down the beach one fine sunny day, feeling
good, when suddenly he sees this woman with no arms or legs in a wheelchair,
sobbing  like crazy.  He decides to be gallant, "What's wrong, miss?"
	"I...<sob, sniffle>...I'm 21 and I <choke> I've never been kissed...
<sniffle>"
	So this guy, he decides, what the hell, let's cheer up the poor lady.
He leans over and gives her a long wonderful kiss.  This does wonders, and
the woman's face lights up and she grins from ear to ear, and the guy wanders
away feeling wonderful.
	Well, next week, the same guy is walking along the same beach, and
sees the same girl who is once again sobbing her eyes out.  Gallant to the
end, our hero says, "What's wrong, miss, can I help?"
	"I...I'm <sob, sniffle, sniffle> 21 and I've never been fucked..."
	The guy picks her up out of her chair, cuddles her close, and brings
her over to the shore, and throws her into the water.  "Now you're fucked!"

This one is for all you military types.  For those who don't know, Rangers
are *extremely* well trained members of the U.S. Army.  Marines are people
who start out as normal soldiers and then are made to believe that bullets
don't actually hurt.
	One day a platoon of Marines are on patrol when they come upon a
Ranger relaxing on top of a small hill. The Ranger puts his hands on his
hips and screams out, "Do any of you seaweed sucking jarheads think you're
man enough to take me on?"
	The biggest Marine comes running up the hill, screaming back at the
Ranger.  When he gets to the top he simply plows into his foe and the two
tumble down the other side of the hill, out of sight.  There is the sound of
a horrendous fight for a moment or two, and then all is quiet.  Soon, the
Ranger reappears, quite untouched.  He puts his hands on his hips and sneers,
"Well, looks to me like one of you couldn't do it, how about the rest?"
	The enraged Marine platoon leader sends his entire platoon (30+men)
charging after the Ranger.  They all go tumbling down the far side of the hill.
After 15 minutes of screaming and yelling and cursing a lone, bloodied Marine
crawls over the top of the hill. The platoon leader yells up to his man,
"What's going on up there?" The wounded Marine, with his last bit of breath,
replies, "Sir, it's a... a trap, sir.  There're two of them!"

This yuppie, see, was in a car wreck.  His BMW was mangled, and so was he.
The paramedic was leaning over him getting his vitals, and all the yup
could groan was "My BMW!  My BMW!"
	The paramedic tried to quiet the man, pointing out that his car
wasn't his chief concern at the moment, especially as he'd been rearranged
pretty badly himself -- for example, his left arm was severed at the elbow
and was lying about twenty feet away.
	There was a moment of stunned silence from the yup followed by
"Oh no!  My Rolex!  My Rolex!"

Two pirates are sitting in a seaside tavern, talking.  One of them has a
hook instead of a hand, and an eye patch.  The other pirate has a wooden
leg.  Over a few beers, they start to tell each other how they received their
injuries.
	"One day," says the first pirate, "we had pulled alongside a merchant
vessel and were boarding her.  I had my sword drawn when suddenly a man with
a saber caught me by surprise and cut my hand off.  So I had this hook put
on.  How did you lose your leg?"
	"From a broadside of grapeshot from an English military vessel, in a
terrific battle off the coast of France.  And how about your eye?"
	"Well, I don't really like to talk about it," said the first pirate.
	"Come on," says the second pirate.  "It doesn't matter after all
these years, does it?"
	"Oh, okay," says the first pirate.  "See, it's pretty embarrassing;
a seagull shit in my eye."
	"A seagull!?  I can see how that would hurt, but I don't see why
you would *lose* the eye..."
	"But," the first pirate says, "it was my first day with the hook."

Two recent emigrants to the United States, on their first day off the boat
in New York City, spied a hotdog vendor.  "Do they eat dogs in America?"
one asked his companion.
	"I don't know."
	"Well, if we're going to live in America, we have to learn to eat
American foods."
	So they each bought a wax paper wrapped hotdog and sat down to eat
them on a nearby park bench.  One man looked inside his wax paper, then over
at the other man, and asked, "So, what part did you get?"

We ought to be very grateful that we have tools.  Millions of years ago
people did not have them, and home projects were extremely difficult. For
example, when a primitive person wanted to put up paneling, he had to drive
the little paneling nails into the cave wall with his bare fist, so
generally the paneling wound up getting spattered with primitive blood,
which isn't really all that bad when you consider how ugly paneling is to
begin with.

What you mean, how old am I?  About one hundred!  But Viennese answer is
better: we say, "I keep passing the open windows."  This is an old joke.
There was a street clown called King of the Mice: he trained rodents, he
did horoscopes, he could impersonate Napoleon, he could make dogs fart
on command.  One night he jumped out his window with all his pets in a box.
Written on the box was this: "Life is serious, but art is fun!"  I hear his
funeral was a party.  A street artist had killed himself.  Nobody had
supported him but now everybody missed him.  Now who would make the dogs
make music and the mice pant?  The bear knows this, too: it is hard work
and great art to make life not so serious.

When I was seven years old, I was once reprimanded by my mother for an
act of collective brutality in which I had been involved at school.  A
group of seven-year-olds had been teasing and tormenting a six-year-old.
"It is always so," my mother said.  "You do things together which not one
of you would think of doing alone." ... Wherever one looks in the world
of human organization, collective responsibility brings a lowering of
moral standards.  The military establishment is an extreme case, an
organization which seems to have been expressly designed to make it
possible for people to do things together which nobody in his right mind
would do alone.

When President Paul Doumer of France was assassinated in Paris in 1932,
newspapers differed in their versions of the event.  This is from "Paris
was Yesterday: 1925-1939" by Janet Flanner, edited by Irving Drutman.

	Taste varied as to his cry when he was shot down, the more popular
	papers preferring his despairing "Oh, la la!," the graver dailies
	favoring "Is it possible?"  What few reported were his dying words:
	"But what kind of chauffeur was it?"  Having been told by his aides
	not that he had been shot but that he had been struck by a taxi, the
	President spent the last conscious moments of his life wondering how
	how an automobile got into the charity book sale at the Maison
	Rothschild, where his assassination occurred.

"if you don't move, I'll have to call a manager."  The man moaned again but
stayed where he was. The usher left, and returned with the manager, who, after
several more attempts at dislodging the fellow, called the police.

... which reminds me of the Carrot family: Ma Carrot, Pa Carrot, and Baby
Carrot.  One fine spring day they decided to go out for a picnic.  They all
piled into their carrot-mobile and drive out to the country.  But Pa Carrot
wasn't watching where he was going and alas, he hit an oil slick and skidded
right into a tree.  Ma and Pa Carrot escaped with a few cuts and bruises, but
poor Baby Carrot got broken in two.  They frantically rushed him to the
hospital and immediately the doctors started operating in a desperate attempt
to save Baby Carrot's life.  Ma and Pa Carrot were beside themselves with
anxiety ... would poor little Baby Carrot make it?
	After hours of waiting the doctor finally emerges, bleary-eyed and
barely able to walk.
	"Is he all right, is he all right?" Pa Carrot frantically stammers.
	"Well, I have some good news and some bad news," replies the doctor.
	Ma and Pa Carrot look at each other and blurt out, nearly in unison,
"The good news first!"
	"All right, the good news is that Baby Carrot will live."
	"And the bad news?  What's the bad news about our Baby Carrot?"
The doctor puts his hand on Pa Carrot's shoulder and solemnly looks him in
the eye.  "Your son will live... but... he'll be a vegetable for the rest of
his life."

Wood is highly ecological, since trees are a renewable resource.  If you cut
down a tree, another will grow in its place.  And if you cut down the new
tree, still another will grow.  And if you cut down that tree, yet another
will grow, only this one will be a mutation with long, poisonous tentacles
and revenge in its heart, and it will sit there in the forest, cackling and
making elaborate plans for when you come back.

Wood heat is not new.  It dates back to a day millions of years ago, when a
group of cavemen were sitting around, watching dinosaurs rot. Suddenly,
lightning struck a nearby log and set it on fire.  One of the cavemen stared
at the fire for a few minutes, then said: "Hey!  Wood heat!" The other
cavemen, who did not understand English, immediately beat him to death with
stones.  But the key discovery had been made, and from that day forward, the
cavemen had all the heat they needed, although their insurance rates went
way up.

	Your home electrical system is basically a bunch of wires that bring
electricity into your home and take if back out before it has a chance to
kill you.  This is called a "circuit".  The most common home electrical
problem is when the circuit is broken by a "circuit breaker"; this causes
the electricity to back up in one of the wires until it bursts out of an
outlet in the form of sparks, which can damage your carpet.  The best way
to avoid broken circuits is to change your fuses regularly.
	Another common problem is that the lights flicker.  This sometimes
means that your electrical system is inadequate, but more often it means
that your home is possessed by demons, in which case you'll need to get a
caulking gun and some caulking.  If you're not sure whether your house is
possessed, see "The Amityville Horror", a fine documentary film based on an
actual book.  Or call in a licensed electrician, who is trained to spot the
signs of demonic possession, such as blood coming down the stairs, enormous
cats on the dinette table, etc.

Big Toe: 
The pad of the male big toe applied to the clitoris or the vulva
generally is a magnificent erotic instrument.  The famous gentleman in erotic
prints who is keeping six women occupied is using tongue, penis, both hands,
and both big toes.  Use the toe in mammary or armpit intercourse or any time
you are astride her, or sit facing as she lies or sits.  Make sure the nail
isn't sharp.  In a restuarant, in these days of tights one can surreptitiously
remove a shoe and sock, reach over, and keep her in almost continuous orgasm
with all four hands fully in view on the table top and no sign of contact--
A party trick which really rates as advanced sex.  She has less scope, but
can learn to masturbate him with her two big toes.  The toes are definitely
erogenic areas, and can be kissed, sucked, tickled, or tied with stimulating
results.

one unscheduled sex technique which a lot of people find extremely exciting

feeling, partly because it's a harmless expression of sexual aggression --
something we badly need, our culture being very uptight about it -- and more
because of its physical affects: slow orgasm when unable to move is a
mind-blowing experience for anyone not too frightened of their own aggressive
self to try it.

Little death (la petite mort):
Some women do indeed pass right out, the 'little death' of French
poetry.  Men occasionally do the same.  The experience is not
unpleasant, but it can scare an inexperienced partner cold.  A friend
of ours had this happen with the first girl he ever slept with.  On
recovery she explained, "I am awfully sorry, but I always do that." By
then he had called the police and an ambulance.  So there is no cause
for alarm, any more than over the yells, convulsions, hysterical
laughter, or sobbing, or any of the other quite unexpected reactions
that go along with complete orgasm in some people.  By contrast others
simply shut their eyes, but enjoy it no less.  Sound and fury can be a
flattering testimony to a partners skills, but a fallacious one,
because they don't depend on the intensity of feeling, nor it upon them.

Pompoir:  

The most sought-after feminine sexual response of all.  

'She must... close and constrict the Yoni until it holds the Lingam as with
a finger, opening and shutting at her pleasure, and finally acting as the
hand of the Gopala-girl who milks the cow.  This can be learned only by long
practice, and especially by throwing the will into the part affected, even
as men endeavor to sharpen their hearing...  Her husband will then value her
above all other women, nor would he exchange her for the most beautiful
queen in the Three Worlds...  Among some races the constrictor vaginae muscles
are abnormally developed.  In Abyssinia for instance, a woman can so exert
them as to cause pain to a man, and when sitting on his thighs, she can
induce orgasm without moving any other part of her person.  Such an artist
is called by the Arabs Kabbazah, literally, a holder, and it's not surprising
that slave dealers pay large sums for her'  Thus Richard Burton.  It has
nothing to do with 'race' but a lot to do with practice.  See exercises.

Viennese Oyster: 
Lady who can cross her feet behind her head, lying on her back, of course.
When she has done so, you hold her tightly round each instep
with your full hand and squeeze, lying on her full-length.  Don't try to put

You can get a very similar sensation -- unique rocking pelvic movement -- with
less expertise if she crosses her ankles on her tummy, knees to shoulders, and
you lie on her crossed ankles with your full weight.  Why "Viennese" we don't
know.  Tolerable for short periods only but gives tremendous genital pressure
for both.

number -- which came to be more and more often, and in the Super Bowl Thomas
was the whole show.  But the season is now over; the purse is safe in the
vault; and Duane Thomas is facing two to twenty for possession.  Nobody really
expects him to serve time, but nobody seems to think he'll be playing for
Dallas next year either, and a few sporting people who claim to know how the
NFL works say he won't be playing for ANYBODY next year; that the Commissioner
is outraged at this mockery of all those Government-sponsored "Beware of Dope"
TV shots that dressed up the screen last autumn.
	We all enjoyed those spots, but not everyone found them convincing.
Here was a White House directive saying several million dollars would be spent

Deliberate provocation of mystical experience, particularly by LSD and
related hallucinogens, in contrast to spontaneous visionary experiences,
entails dangers that must not be underestimated.  Practitioners must take
into account the peculiar effects of these substances, namely their ability
to influence our consciousness, the innermost essence of our being.  The
history of LSD to date amply demonstrates the catastrophic consequences that
can ensue when its profound effect is misjudged and the substance is mistaken
for a pleasure drug.  Special internal and external advance preparations
are required; with them, an LSD experiment can become a meaningful experience.

	Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes of Harvard Medical School inhaled ether
at a time when it was popularly supposed to produce such mystical or
"mind-expanding" experiences, much as LSD is supposed to produce such
experiences today.  Here is his account of what happened:
	"I once inhaled a pretty full dose of ether, with the determination
to put on record, at the earliest moment of regaining consciousness, the
thought I should find uppermost in my mind.  The mighty music of the triumphal
march into nothingness reverberated through my brain, and filled me with a
sense of infinite possibilities, which made me an archangel for a moment.
The veil of eternity was lifted.  The one great truth which underlies all
human experience and is the key to all the mysteries that philosophy has
sought in vain to solve, flashed upon me in a sudden revelation.  Henceforth
all was clear: a few words had lifted my intelligence to the level of the
knowledge of the cherubim.  As my natural condition returned, I remembered
my resolution; and, staggering to my desk, I wrote, in ill-shaped, straggling
characters, the all-embracing truth still glimmering in my consciousness.
The words were these (children may smile; the wise will ponder):
`A strong smell of turpentine prevails throughout.'"

People who claim to know jackrabbits will tell you they are primarily
motivated by Fear, Stupidity and Craziness.  But I have spent enough time in
jackrabbit country to know that most of them lead pretty dull lives; they are
bored with their daily routines:  eat, fuck, sleep, hop around a bush now and
then... No wonder some of them drift over the line into cheap thrills once in
a while; there has to be a powerful adrenalin rush in crouching by the side of
a road, waiting for the next set of headlights to come along, then streaking
out of the bushes with split-second timing and making it across to the other
side just inches in front of the speeding front wheels.
	Why not?  Anything that gets the adrenalin moving like a 440 volt
blast in a copper bathtub is good for the reflexes and keeps the veins free
of cholesterol ...  but too many adrenalin rushes in any given time-span has
the same bad effect on the nervous system as too many electro-shock treatments
are said to have on the brain:  after a while you start burning out the
circuits.
	When a jackrabbit gets addicted to road running, it is only a matter
of time before he gets smashed -- and when a journalist turns into a politics
junkie he will sooner or later start raving and babbling in print about things
that only a person who has Been There can possibly understand.

	The radio was screaming: "Power to the People -- Right On!" John

chew it up like baseball gum."

We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the
drugs began to take hold.  I remember saying something like "I feel a bit
lightheaded; maybe you should drive...."  And suddenly there was a terrible
roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all
swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a
hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas.  And a voice was
screaming: "Holy Jesus!  What are these goddamn animals?"
	Then it was quiet again.  My attorney had taken his shirt off and
was pouring beer on his chest, to facilitate the tanning process.  "What the
hell are you yelling about?" he muttered, staring up at the sun with his
eyes closed and covered with wraparound Spanish sungalsses.  "Never mind,"
I said.  "It's your turn to drive."  I hit the brakes and aimed the Great

bats, I thought.  The poor bastard will see them soon enough.

A 6'8", 280-pound Southerner walked into a NY bar, sat down next to a
patron, and said, "Ah'm big, and ah'm bad, and I *loves* to fuck Northern
women!"  The guy was so terrified that he put down his beer and ran out
of the bar.
	The Rebel moved over to the next guy and said, "Ah'm big and ah'm
bad and I *loves* to fuck New York women."  The guy took one look at him,
blanched and ran out of the bar.
	The man then went over to a short little guy with "Bronx" written
all over him.  "Ah'm big and ah'm bad and I *loves* to fuck your sister."
	The short guy looked him up and down and said, "I don't blame
you one bit.  She's *got* to be an improvement on yours."

A fisherman from Maine went to Alabama on his vacation.  He rented a boat,
rowed out to the middle of the lake, and cast his line, but when he looked
down into the water he was horrified to see a man wrapped in chains lying
on the bottom of the lake.  He quickly rowed to shore and ran to the police
station.  "Sheriff, sheriff," he gasped, there's a guy wrapped in chains,
drowned in the lake!"
	"Now ain't that jest like a Yankee," drawled the sheriff, "to steal
more chain than he can swim with?"

A lanky Texan was mad because Texas had just become the second largest state in
the Union, so he made up his mind to move to Alaska.  He drove for three days
and three nights to get there and finally he came to what looked like the state
line.  He halted his car and walked up to the border guard.  "Hi, there!  How
do I become a resident of this here biggest state?" demanded the Texan.
	The guard looked him up and down and grinned.  "Waal," he answered,
there are three things you gotta do to get in.  First, drink down a quart of
110 proof corn liquor without blinkin'.  Second, kill a grizzly bear, and
third, make love to an Eskimo woman."
	"Sounds easy enough," said the Texan.  "Where can I get a quart of
this here corn liquor?"
	"Got one right here," replied the guard.
	The Texan gulped down the whiskey without batting an eyelash.
"Now, do you happen to know where I can find me a grizzly?"
	"Yep," answered the guard, "there's a big b'ar over that way, 'bout
a mile... lives in a cave on that cliff."
	The Texan lurched merrily off.  About an hour later he returned
with his clothes almost torn off and his face scratched and bloody.  He was
smiling happily.  "Now," he roared, "where's that damn Eskimo woman you
want killed?"

A little Mexican boy comes home from school one day and says to his grand-

used to raid towns around here!  Did you ever know him?"
	"Do *I* know Pancho Villa?" exclaims the man.  "Why, boy, before

down off the horse and to give him all my money.  Then, he told me to scoop
some manure from the ground and eat it!"
	"I refused at first, but Pancho had the guns, so I ate the shit.
And he started laughing so hard that it scared his horse into rearing up --
I grabbed the guns from his hands!  I said to Pancho, `Okay, Pancho, now
it's your turn -- you eat the shit!'  I had the guns, so he ate the shit.

and asks why it is so much.  "Well, the bird is fluent in Italian and
French and can recite the periodic table."  He points to another bird
and is told that it costs 90,000 zlotys because it speaks French and
German, can knit and can curse in Latin.

told, "that one is 150,000."
	"Why, what can it do?" he asks.

Although a fifth-generation American, Father Sweeny was more Irish than most
of Erin's natives.  He spoke with an Irish brogue which had mysteriously
appeared during his nineteenth year and he *hated* the English.  Due to his
proclivity to belabor the British from his pulpit, complaints to his
superiors were not infrequent.  He would blame anything evil or merely
inconvenient on the English people.  If there was an act of terrorism, the
responsibility was promptly laid at the feet of the Brits.  If there was a
natural disaster, undoubtedly the English government was an accessory to
the fact, if not outrightly culpable.  Repeatedly, his superiors called him
on the carpet for his behavior.  After a particularly vituperative
anti-British broadside, the Bishop instructed Father Sweeny to come straight
to his office; do not pass GO; do not collect two hundred dollars.  Summing
up a humiliating and soul-marking reprimand, the Bishop ended with: "Next
week is Saint Patrick's Day.  If you so much as *mention* the British, it's
your last sermon!"

The following Sunday, as Father Sweeny spoke lovingly and eloquently of
Saint Patrick, and he made a reference to the last Passover celebrated by
Christ and His disciples.  "Sure, an' you're all familiar with the tale.
You know that Our Lord sat at the table and told his disciples that one
among them would betray Him.  As He looked around the table, He stopped at
Peter, the Rock, who said, `Not I, Lord!'  He looked at Thomas, who doubted,
and Thomas said, `I could never do such a thing!'  Then the Lord looked long
and hard at Judas Iscariot, who said, `Cor, bloimy, Guv'na, you couldn't
main may!'"

evening, who took him to her apartment.  They made delicious love all
evening before drifting to sleep in each others' arms.  In the morning
the man dressed, staring into a full-length mirror.  The lady lay in her
bed watching him.  Finally, she said softly,
	"Didn't you forget something?"
	"What did I forget?" asked the officer.
	"You forgot about the money," said the lady.
	"Oh, no," said the man, standing at ramrod attention. "A Polish
officer never accepts money."

Israeli prime minister Shamir invited the Pope to play a round of golf.  Since
the Pope hadn't the faintest of an idea how to play, he convened the college of
cardinals to ask their advice.  "Call Arnold Palmer," they suggested, "make him
a cardinal and let him play in your place.  Tell Shamir you couldn't make it."
	Honored by His Holiness' request, Palmer agreed to represent him.
When he returned from the match, the Pope asked him how he had done.  "I came
in second," Palmer replied.
	"You mean to tell me Shamir beat you?"
	"No, Your Holiness.  Rabbi Nicklaus did."

Murray and Esther, a middle-aged Jewish couple, are touring Chile.
Murray just got a new camera and is constantly snapping pictures.  One day,

prison.
	They can't prove who they are because they've left their passports

to death.
	The next morning they're lined up in front of the wall where they'll

any last requests.  Esther wants to know if she can call her daughter in
Chicago.  The sergeant says he's sorry, that's not possible, and turns to

On one hot dusty day in 1860, a lone Mexican bandit crossed the border into
Texas.  After robbing a small bank and shooting up the town, he led the posse
on a merry chase through the desert.  On the sixth day of the chase he was
apprehended.

At this point, the sheriff loses his cool.  His town has been shot up, his
bank robbed, he's spent a week in the desert tracking this guy, and now he
says he'll never tell.  So he takes his pistol, jams it under the bandits'
chin, and, with the veins standing out on his neck, screams "Tell him to tell
me where the money is, or I'm gonna blow his brains all over the desert!"

	The Soviet pre-eminence in chess can be traced to the average
Russian's readiness to brood obsessively over anything, even the arrangement
of some pieces of wood.  Indeed, the Russians' predisposition for quiet
reflection followed by sudden preventive action explains why they led the
field for many years in both chess and ax murders.  It is well known that as
early as 1970, the U.S.S.R., aware of what a defeat at Reykjavik would do to
national prestige, implemented a vigorous program of preparation and
incentive.  Every day for an entire year, a team of psychologists, chess
analysts and coaches met with the top three Russian grand masters and
threatened them with a pointy stick.  That these tactics proved fruitless
is now a part of chess history and a further testament to the American way,
which provides that if you want something badly enough, you can always go to
Iceland and get it from the Russians.

The key members of this group are the representatives from Moscow, Bonn, and
Jerusalem, who, despite their personal enmity, manage to forge a peaceful
settlement, at the last moment.  As the treaty is signed, and the war
postponed, almost entirely through the efforts of those three men, an angel
appears. "The earth is saved through the efforts of these three men!
Therefore, I will grant each of them their heart's desire!"

Russians, immediately says "I wish there were no more Russians!"  And God

A huge Rambolike fellow walked into a tavern and took a seat in the middle of
the bar.  After downing a double in one gulp, he glared at the six men to his
right and said, "You're all no-good motherfuckers.  Anyone have a problem with
that?"
	When no one said a word, the brawny fellow ordered another whiskey,
downed it in one gulp, turned to the five men on his left and said, "You're
all cocksuckers.  Anyone have a problem with that?"
	Everybody on the left stared silently into his drink.  Suddenly, a man
on the right stood up and started walking toward the big guy.  "Hey, asshole!"
the thug bellowed.  "You got a problem with what I said?"
	"No problem at all," came the reply.  "I was just sitting at the wrong
end of the bar."

A lisping fag fell off a pleasure yacht and began to scream.  "Help! Help, I

over the rail, remarking, "Really, there's no need to scream.  Just reach out
and grab that buoy near you."  To which the floundering sodomite answered,
"Buoy!  Oh, thith ith no time for thekth, you degenerate... I'm dwowning!"

A man rushed into a bar and breathlessly asked the bartender to pour him
three straight scotches.  The bartender complied, and watched as he downed
them one after another.
	"Why three scotches?" the bartender asked as he paused for breath.
	"Well, to be honest, I'm celebrating my first blow-job."
	"Hell, congratulations, the next one's on me."
	"No, thanks," the young man replied, "if the first three didn't get
the taste out of my mouth, I don't think another one will."

	A man walks into a bar and orders 3 shots and 3 beers.  The
bartender, seeing that the man is distraught, asks what the problem is.
	"I just found out that my brother is gay", he replies.
	About a week later, the same man walks in and orders 6 shots and
6 chasers.  So the bartender inquires, "What's wrong this time?"
	To which the man says, "I just found out that two of my brothers
are lovers."
	Another week goes by and the man comes back to the bar and orders
NINE shots and NINE beers.  The bartenders says "Damn, boy, doesn't anyone
in your family like pussy?"
	"Yeah.  Me and my sister."

A ten-year-old kid came home from school one day, and when his mom
asked how was school he says: "Gee, great, mom.  I got laid!"
	She's shocked and sends him upstairs, where his dad finds him after
work.  "Mommy told me about your day at school, Billy, and I think we men
should keep it a secret.  Women just don't understand these things."
	So every night Dad goes up to Billy's room after Mom tucks him in:
"You get laid today, Billy?"
	"Yeah, Dad."
	"How was it?"
	"Real neat, Dad, I liked it a lot."
	"Good Boy!".
	A month later: "You get laid today?"
	"No, Dad."
	"No?  How come?"
	"Gee, Dad, my ass is getting really sore."

A young man walks into a bus station, and goes into the men's room to relieve
himself.  When he steps in he sees a leprechaun with the most enormous penis
he has ever seen.  As he urinates, he cannot avoid spying on the giant member
of the tiny man dressed in green.  The leprechaun zips up and the man asks him
if he is indeed a real leprechaun.
	The little man says, "Aye, me laddie, I'm a leprechaun, and I can
grant you three wishes."
	"Oh, wow!" comes the reply, "What do I need to do?"
	"Well, havin' such a large cock makes it a bit awkward with the
ladies, the thing not fittin' and all...  I'll grant you your three wishes
if you wouldn't mind suckin' me dick 'til I come."  The man is a bit taken
aback, but agrees, realizing that the three wishes will be priceless.  After
the tiny fellow has come, he starts to walk away.
	The man exclaims, "Hey, what about my three wishes?"
	Replies the leprechaun, "How old are you, me boy?"
	"25."
	"Aren't you a wee bit old to be believin' in leprechauns?"

Another stupid gay joke!!!
	You see, this gay man walks into a Texas bar and orders a strawberry
daquiri.  The bartender looks him over with amusement and says: "We don't 
serve your kind, buddy, why don't you get out of here before the boys come
in and kick your ass?"
	The guy whimpers a little and lisps, "Pleasse misssture I am soooo
thurstay...."
	Well, the bartender feels somewhat sorry for him and hands him a beer
on the house on the condition that he drink it in the back and leave as soon 
as he's done.  A little while later, a hulking cowboy walks in and up to the 
bar.  He slams his fist on the bar and hollers, "I'm so thirsty, I could
lick the sweat off of a bulls' balls!"
	From the back of the bar comes the cry...  "Moo, moo, buckaroooooo!!!"

	Bubba, Jim Bob, and Leroy were fishing out on the lake last November,
and, when Bubba tipped his head back to empty the Jim Beam, he fell out of the
boat into the lake.  Jim Bob and Leroy pulled him back in, but as Bubba didn't
look too good, they started up the Evinrude and headed back to the pier.
	By the time they got there, Bubba was turning kind of blue, and his
teeth were chattering like all get out.  Jim Bob said, "Leroy, go run up to
the pickup and get Doc Pritchard on the CB, and ask him what we should do".
	Doc Pritchard, after hearing a description of the case, said "Now,
Leroy, listen closely.  Bubba is in great danger.  He has hy-po-thermia.  Now
what you need to do is get all them wet clothes off of Bubba, and take your
clothes off, and pile your clothes and jackets on top of him.  Then you all
get under that pile, and hug up to Bubba real close so that you warm him up.
You understand me Leroy?  You gotta warm Bubba up, or he'll die."
	Leroy and the Doc 10-4'ed each other, and Leroy came back to the
pier.  "Wh-Wh-What'd th-th-the d-d-doc s-s-say L-L-Leroy?", Bubba chattered.
	"Bubba, Doc says you're gonna die."

	Elroy stared at Barb and then leaned quietly over to Shake Tiller

	Shake looked solemnly at Elroy, clasping his hand, and said:
	"I got to be dead honest, Roy."
	And Elroy said yeah, lay it on him.
	Shake said slowly, "For a Lesbian who gave up the only real love she
ever knew -- Sister Francis at Our Lady of Victory -- and for a person who
can't make it any more with nothing but an electric toothbrush, she's the
finest I've ever had."

For months the loving newlywed had asked his blushing bride to perform oral
sex on him, but to no avail.  His sweet entreaties never worked, for she was
simply too innocent and inexperienced to even *think* of such a thing, let
alone attempt it.  But a year of gentle persistence finally paid off, and
one night his darling nervously but lovingly performed the act.  When it was
over, she looked deeply into his eyes, blushed, and asked, "How was I,
sweetheart?"
	He looked at her and replied, "How should I know -- I'm no cocksucker!"

	"Hello, Police Department."
	"This is Thomas Parrish, 903 Sylvester Court.  I've just been sexually

	"Just remain calm, sir, and tell me about it."
	"Well, the man came in the window wearing a ski mask.  I was napping
on the bed, in just my pajamas, and the TV set was on so I didn't hear anything.
Suddenly he had his great big old callused hand over my mouth, holding me down.
I tried to scream... he was pulling my pants off.  I was so frightened!  He
held a knife to my throat and undressed so quickly.  What could I do?  I
couldn't stop him.  He was huge.  A great, hairy, beefy man, more than fifty 
pounds heavier than I am, and hung like... Oh! it was terrible.  He had an
erection, and he knelt on my shoulders and forced the awful thing down my
throat; forced me to suck it.  Yes, officer!  There was no escaping this man.
Finally, when I thought I would faint, he got off me and turned me over on 
my tummy, forcing my legs apart with his knees, and oh! I'm so embarrassed to
say it, he put that huge thing...  It must have been a foot long, and I don't
know how thick... into my...  Just a minute."
	"What's the matter, mister?"
	"Listen, I have to hang up now, he's getting out of the shower."

One fall day, two men were out in the woods hunting.  Feeling a sudden need
to relieve himself, George went over to a nearby clump of bushes, unzipped
his fly, and started in when a poisonous snake lunged out of the bushes and
bit him on his penis.  Hearing George's howl of pain and fright, his friend
Fred came running up and told him to lie still while he used the radio to
call a doctor.
	"There's only one way to save your friend's life," said the doctor
gravely.  "If you cut a shallow 'X' over the bite and then suck as much of
the poison out as you can, he'll probably be okay, but otherwise there's not
much hope."
	Hearing Fred's footsteps, George rose weakly up on one elbow and
cried out, "Fred, what'd he say?  What did the doctor say?"
	"George, old friend," said Fred sadly, "he said you're gonna die."

Out on the great American desert one day, a bald eagle reached a
state of great libidal distress.  Pickings were slim, but in time, he saw a
dove flying by.  "Better than nothin'", he muttered (birds in jokes can mutter)
and swooped down, grabbed the dove and flew to his nest.  Feathers flew, and
eventually the dove tottered to the edge of the cliff and shouted (yes, they
shout, too):
	"I'm a dove!  I've been loved!  And I LIKE it!"
	Well, this took care of the old boy for a while but soon enough he
was at it again.  All he could find was a lark, so away he went, and feathers
flew and soon the lark tottered to the edge of the cliff and shouted:
	"I'm a lark!  I've been sparked!  And I LIKE it!"
	As you can guess, some time later our friend was again in need of
amor... lib... you know!  This time, all that happened by was... a duck!

tottering to the cliffside and shouting:

The new rooster caused a great stir in the barnyard.  From resplendent comb
to defiant spurs, he was the picture of young bantamhood.  Almost immediately
upon arrival, he was greeted by and elderly rooster who took him behind the
barn and whispered in his ear: "Young fellow, I'm long past my prime.  All I
want now is peace and solitude.  So you take over right now as ruler of the
roost with my blessings."
	The newcomer did just that.  He went about his squirely duties as only
a young rooster could.  After several days, however, the elder rooster again
took the young champion behind the barn.  "Kid," he said, "the hens are after
me for giving up my position so readily.  So why don't we have a race, say,
ten laps around the farmhouse?  The winner becomes undisputed keeper of the
henhouse and the hens will stop nagging me.
	The young rooster, with only contempt for his elder, agreed.  
Surprisingly, the older one jumped off to an early lead.  His counterpart, 
weakened by the activities of the previous week, was never quite able to
overtake him.  As they rounded the barn for the fourth time, the elder rooster 
maintained a formidable lead.
	Suddenly, a shotgun blast rang out.  The young rooster fell in the 
dust, his plumage riddled with buckshot.
	"Dammit, Emmy," said the farmer.  "That's the last rooster we buy
from Ferguson.  Four of 'em this month, and every one's been queer."

youth pointed to another, somewhat larger boy smirking in the corner.
"That's him, sir, the one who forced me to do all those crimes against
nature.  The bully!"
	"Now tell me, son, as closely as you can, when this happened."
	"Sir, two weeks ago on Wednesday at 4:00, then at 7:00 that same 
evening, on Friday, twice on Saturday, two times on Monday, once on

The world is so full of a number of things,
I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings.

	It stank like a beast,
And the odor killed flies as they gathered to feast.

What a wonderful family!  What marvellous style!
I'll bet you and I aren't close by a mile.
	Their odor and diet
	Won't soon be forgotton,
And one day you and I may be equally rotten.

Upon leaving a hotel bar one evening, an executive noticed a drunk sitting
on the edge of a potted palm in the lobby, crying like a baby.  Because he'd
had a couple himself that night, and was feeling rather sorry for his fellow
man, he asked the inebriated one what the trouble was.
	"I did a terrible thing tonight," sniffled the drunk.  "I sold my
wife to a guy for a bottle of Scotch."
	"That is terrible," said the man, too much under the weather to 
muster any real indignation.  "And now that she's gone, you wish you had her
back."
	"Thas right," said the drunk, still sniffling.
	"You're sorry you sold her, because you realize too late that you
love her," sympathized the executive.
	"No, no," said the drunk.  "I wish I had her back because I'm

Fortune's Rules for Memo Wars: #1

	Any attempt to say that someone's personal beliefs are wrong, even if
you supply conclusive evidence to support your claim, is an outright attack.
If you show someone a flaw in his/her logic, they have every right to punch
you in the face.  Mathematical proofs of errors are the moral equivalent
of rape and should be avoided at all cost.
	Now... your opponent has requested a "rational discussion".  What do
you do?  Well, remember that people are normally willing to discuss things
rationally if and only if you agree with them; anything less would obviously
not be rational.  Therefore, agree immediately, and continue as before.
	Always assume that whenever you see someone making a statement about
"certain parties who shall remain nameless", "some people", "assholes", etc.,
they are talking about *you*.  It is also correct to assume that words you
don't understand, such as "prestidigatory", "lapidarian", and "buprestid",
are direct personal attacks aimed at your loved ones and merit an equally
scathing response.  Failure to do this results in many lost opportunities for
rational discussion.  (See above.)

Fortune's Rules for Memo Wars: #3

The proper time for a vicious ad hominem attack is when you have no logical
recourse.  If you have been arguing a point with a person or persons for
30 odd weeks, and an memo comes across that logically tears down the
final shred of evidence that you thought you had, that is the time to call
the author of that memo:
	1: a mindless twit who attacks other people's beliefs for no reason.
	2: an egotistical flaming typical wombat aggie melon-humping
	   cheese-whizzing nanosexual subuseless clamsucker whose memos
	   are apparently sneezed onto his/her terminal.
	3: something unpleasant.
The OTHER proper time for an ad hominem attack is immediately after someone
has posted something you don't understand.  Given the current state of modern
electronic communications technology your inability to comprehend the meaning
of an memo constitutes a violation of western moral tradition on the part of
the author of that memo, and the author should be taken to task publicly via
a series of really nasty, name-calling oriented memos.

Four Oxford dons were taking their evening walk together and as
usual, were engaged in casual but learned conversation.  On this particular
evening, their conversation was about the names given to groups of animals,
such as a "pride of lions" or a "gaggle of geese."
	One of the professors noticed a group of prostitutes down the block,
and posed the question, "What name would be given to that group?"  The four
fell into silence for a moment, as they pondered the possibilities...
	At last, one spoke: "How about 'a Jam of Tarts'?"  The others nodded
in acknowledgement as they continued to consider the problem.  A second
professor spoke: "I'd suggest 'an Essay of Trollops.'"  Again, the others
nodded.  A third spoke: "I propose 'a Flourish of Strumpets.'"
	They continued their walk in silence, until the first professor
remarked to the remaining professor, who was the most senior and learned of
the four, "You haven't suggested a name for our ladies.  What are your
thoughts?"
	Replied the fourth professor, "'An Anthology of Prose.'"

OLD FELLA RED CLARET
	Produce of Australia -- "The Big 69'er"

An unusual "Rough-as-Guts" wine that has the Distinctive Bouquet of old
and ill-cared for animals.  It is best drunk with the teeth clenched to
prevent ingestion of the seeds and skins.  Connoisseurs will savour the
slight Tannin Taste of burnt shag feathers and soiled medical dressings.
Possessors of a cultivated Palate admire the initial assault on the taste
buds which comes from the careful and loving blending of circus hosings
with perished jock straps.  The maturing in Midland Abattoir hogsheads
gives it a very Definite Nose.  With the bouquet like an aborigine's armpit.
In the United States this wine is marketed as Crow Brand (9 out of 10 people
who drink it for the first time exclaim "VRAAAARRRRRK").

It won a Bronze at the "Kings Cross Homosexuals Convention" of 1973

Once upon a time there was a boy, who tried very, very hard to be a Good
Little Boy.  He grew up to try to be a Good Man.
	But he never understood how he could be either.
	Finally, one day, after years of chronic worry and months of
outright crisis, he admitted that he couldn't do either, because at some
level, he wasn't even male.
	So she tried to be a Good Little Girl, and soon after, tried to
learn to be a Good Woman.
	Unfortunately, she didn't look much like Barbie.  More like Ken,
I suppose.
	So, she lost some friends.  But she loved herself, and that was
more important.  Then she lost her career, but that wasn't so important,
because it was *his* career she lost.  Her family tried to accept; all of
them stopped using the old name.  One of them even tried the new one, a
few times.  She couldn't get a job--"That's no woman!" seemed to bar her
even from jobs that didn't require interior plumbing.  But it was all
right, because she had learned to stop trying to be a Good Anything At
All, and loving herself, *was* herself.
	Then the heat went off, and the food ran out, the eviction notice
came and there wasn't anywhere left to borrow money from.  So she filled
the tub, heating water in a kettle on the stove, and gently, lovingly,
cut her wrists.

The moral of the story: The ugly duckling makes a dandy meal.  Dig in.

And what accomplished villains these old engineers were!  What diabolical
ways to sabotage they found!  Nikolai Karlovich von Meck, of the People's
Comissariat of Railroads ... would hold forth for hours on end about the
economic problems involved in the construction of socialism, and he loved to
give advice.  One such pernicious piece of advice was to increase the size
of freight trains and not worry about heavier than average loads.  The GPU
exposed van Meck, and he was shot: his objective had been to wear out rails
and roadbeds, freight cars and locomotives, so as to leave the Republic
without railroads in case of foreign military intervention!  When, not long
afterward, the new People's Commissar of Railroads ordered that average
loads should be increased, and even doubled and tripled them, the malicious
engineers who protested became known as limiters ... they were rightly
shot for their lack of faith in the possibilities of socialist transport.

only three parachutes could be found for the four passengers!  Andropov

jumped to safety.  Now if you are following all this (or counting on your

Soviet Space Research Institute noted that the Soviet Government has offered
to convert its gigantic Krasnoyarsk radar in Siberia into an international
space research facility in response to U.S. complaints that the radar would
violate the ABM treaty.  Sagdeev suggested that the U.S. reciprocate by
turning the unfinished U.S. embassy in Moscow into a nuclear crisis reduction
center.  The communication system, he pointed out, is already in place.

Stalin was dying, and summoned Khruschev to his bedside.  Wheezing his last
words with difficulty, Stalin tells Khruschev, "The reins of the country are
now in your hands.  But before I go, I want to give you some advice."
	"Yes, yes, what is it?" says Khruschev, impatiently.  Reaching under
his pillow, Stalin produced two envelopes labeled #1 and #2.
	"Take these letters," he tells Khruschev. "Keep them safely -- don't
open them.  Only if the country is in turmoil and things aren't going well,
open the first one.  That'll give you some advice on what to do.  And, if
after that, if things start getting REALLY bad, open the second one."  And
with a gasp Stalin breathed his last.
	Well, within a few years Khruschev started having problems --
unemployment increased, crops failed, people became restless.  He decided it
was time to open the first letter.  All it said was: "Blame everything on me!"
So Khruschev launched a massive deStalinization campaign, and blamed Stalin
for all the excesses and purges and ills of the present system.
	But things continued on the downslide, and, finally, after much
deliberation, Khruschev opened the second letter.
	All it said was: "Write two letters."

The cry has been that when war is declared, all opposition should therefore
be hushed.  A sentiment more unworthy of a free country could hardly be
propagated.  If the doctrine be admitted, rulers have only to declare war

The entire work force of the Communist countries is subjected to periodic
purges (called verifications in Newspeak).  One of the most severe took
place in 1957 when Novotny, rattled by the Hungarian Revolution the year
before, tried hard to weed out "radishes" (red outside, white inside) from
all but insignificant positions.  Any one of the following would often
result in the loss of one's job:  Bourgeois or Jewish family background,
relatives abroad, contacts with former capitalists, having lived in a
Western country, insufficient knowledge of Communist literature, and others.

	A man is interviewed by a "Verification Committee."
	"What kind of family do you come from?"

The most recent attempt to revive the moribund campus left, a national
conference held at Rutgers University February 5-7, ended when the
participants decided that they were too racist to found a new national 
organization.
	The stated goal of the conference was the formation of a national
organization that would "give expression to a shared consciousness."  The
orientation materials declared that this was "a historic moment" -- you
know, like Port Huron and the Sixties -- and the Rutgers host committee had
every reason to expect their goal would be accomplished.
	But it was not to be.  Given that this was a conference of *New*
New Leftists, reason had nothing to do with it.
	A revealing article by Vania del Borgo and Maria Margaronis in "The
Nation", ["Beyond the Fragments," 3/26/88] says "The defining moment of the
weekend came when the conference was almost at its end.  On Sunday morning,
a twenty-five-member students of color caucus confronted the assembled body
with its overwhelming whiteness..."  Joined by the Gay & Bisexual Caucus, the
Students of Color Caucus declared that the founding of such an overwhelmingly
white organization would itself constitute a racist act.  The four hundred or
so leftist activists were told that they had no right to ratify a constitution
or elect any officers.  While recognizing "the need to examine the real
possibilities of a broad-based, racially diverse student movement" and paying
lip service to the need for "dialogue," they threatened to walk out if their
demands were not met.  As *The Nation* article describes the scene:  "To their
astonishment, their intervention was greeted with a standing ovation." Handed
an ultimatum which demanded that they disband, this would-be successor to the
radical student movements of the Sixties promptly voted itself out of
existence.  As del Borgo and Margaronis put it, "After much chaotic discussion
and a confused voice vote, the convention suspended all its other work and
broke into regional groups to discuss 'outreach.'"

THE MX IS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY.  One important reason we have a Defense
Department is that when we give it money, it spends it, which creates
jobs, whereas if we left the money in the hands of civilians, we don't
know what they'd do with it.  Probably put it in open trenches and set
it on fire.  The MX will create an especially large number of jobs
because of the number of warheads it carries.  It carries a total of 10
warheads.  This creates a great deal of employment, because you have
your Warhead Makers, your Warhead Lifters, your Persons Who Tap the
Warheads Gently with Rubber Mallets to Wedge Them All Snugly Into the
Nose Cone, your Persons Who Just Walk Around Playing Soothing Cassettes
by Recording Artists such as Perry Como So We Don't Have Any More
Episodes Where a Worker Who is Experiencing Some Strain Sticks a

the silos.  What this means, of course, is that if we ever needed them to
help obliterate all human life on the planet, they could be a real

Within a month [in 1969] I had met the first of a small but not uninfluential
community of people who violently opposed SALT for a simple reason: It might
keep America from developing a first-strike capability against the Soviet
Union.  I'll never forget being lectured by an Air Force colonel about how
we should have "nuked" the Soviets in late 1940s before they got The Bomb.
I was told that if SALT would go away, we'd soon have the capability to nuke
them again -- and this time we'd use it.

You buy a judge by weight, like iron in a junk yard.  A justice of the
peace or a magistrate can be had for a five-dollar bill.  In the
municipal courts, he will cost you ten.  In the circuit or superior
courts, he wants fifteen.  The state appellate courts or the state
supreme court is on a par with the Federal courts.  By the time a judge
reaches such courts, he is middle-aged, thick around the middle, fat
between the ears.  He's heavy.  You can't buy a Federal judge for less

A certain bartender decided to try to get a few new customers into his bar
by starting a gimmick involving a horse.  His claim was that if anyone could
get the horse to laugh, he would give them drinks on the house.  The idea
worked well and business improved until one night a young man walked in and
whispered in the horse's ear.  The horse immediately burst into hysterical
laughter and the man won the contest.  The next night the same thing
happened: the man whispered in the horse's ear and the horse burst out
laughing.  The next night, the bartender decided to change the rules.  Now,
a person had to get the horse to cry in order to win the drinks on the
house.  Later on that night, the same guy came in and said "Can I take the
horse into the bathroom for a minute?  I promise I'll make him cry."  The
bartender agreed and sure enough, when the man came out leading the horse,
the horse was crying his eyes out.  The bartender could take it no more and
said, "How did you make him laugh the other two nights?"
	"I told him that my dick was bigger than his", replied the man.
	"How did you make him cry tonight?"
	"I proved it."

A cowboy, his horse and his dog were captured by hostile Indians.
This wasn't really a problem for the animals as the Indians can always use
them, but the cowboy is informed that he will be burned at the stake the
following sunrise.  That evening, the Indian chief tells the cowboy that
he can one last wish, within reason, of course, before meeting his fate
the following morning.  The cowboy replies that all he really wants is to
see his faithful dog, Rex, one last time.  When the dog is brought by the
Indians, the cowboy hugs his companion and whispers something into his ear.
At once the dog runs off over the hill.  Amazingly enough, a few hours later,
he returns, accompanied by some two dozen prostitutes from a nearby town.
Needless to say, the braves are delighted and as a reward offer the cowboy
his dog to keep him company through the rest of the night.  When the dog is
brought forth the cowboy again runs his hand over Rex's head and then bends
down to whisper into his ear: "This may be my last chance, Rex, so get it
right this time -- go into town and get the posse!"

	A great American Olympic wrestler was receiving last-minute advice
from his coach about the upcoming match with the Soviet Champion.
 	"This Russian guy is really good, very strong and quick.  But I think
you can take him.  Remember, though, like I've told you before, don't let
him get you in the Pretzel hold.  With his strength you'd never get out."
	The American leaps onto the mat, and within moments the two behemoths
are going crazy, struggling to get each other pinned.  The American slowly
gains ground and appears that he might actually win on points alone, when, in
the blink of an eye, the Russian reverses him and whips him into the fatal
Pretzel hold.
	The coach, off by the side, shakes his head in dismay, and sits down
on the bench with his head between his hands.  All of a sudden, there's a
scream and the two wrestlers fly apart, the American regaining control and
pinning the Russian.  After the match, in the dressing room, the coach
finally gets the winner alone.  "Great job!  But how the hell did you get out
of the Pretzel Hold?  I thought it was over for sure!"
 	"Well, I did too.  I was in the hold, about to be pinned, when I saw
this huge pair of testicles hanging right in front of my eyes.  I figured
what the hell, so I stretched forward and bit them as hard as I could.  Coach,

	A group of soldiers being prepared for a practice landing on a tropical
island were warned of the one danger the island held, a poisonous snake that
could be readily identified by its alternating orange and black bands.  They
were instructed, should they find one of these snakes, to grab the tail end of
the snake with one hand and slide the other hand up the body of the snake to
the snake's head.  Then, forcefully, bend the thumb above the snake's head
downward to break the snake's spine.  All went well for the landing, the
charge up the beach, and the move into the jungle.  At one foxhole site, two
men were starting to dig and wondering what had happened to their partner.
Suddenly he staggered out of the underbrush, uniform in shreds, covered with
blood.  He collapsed to the ground.  His buddies were so shocked they could
only blurt out, "What happened?"
	"I ran from the beachhead to the edge of the jungle, and, as I hit the
ground, I saw an orange and black striped snake right in front of me.  I
grabbed its tail end with my left hand.  I placed my right hand above my left
hand.  I held firmly with my left hand and slid my right hand up the body of
the snake.  When I reached the head of the snake I flicked my right thumb down

	Ever thought of putting a ferret down your pants?  Yes, ferrets,
those weasel-like animals originally trained to hunt rats and possessing
needle sharp claws and razor sharp teeth.  The English do it for sport.
	Ferret Legging involves the tying of a competitors's trousers at
the ankles and then dropping into the trousers a couple of vicious ferrets.
No jockstraps or underwear allowed -- nothing but the bodies' own.  The
ferrets must be young and in good condition.  Neither the ferret or the
contestant may be drugged or drunk -- cold eyed sober only.  The trousers
should be loose fitting, to allow the ferret to scramble from one leg to
the other, and are traditionally white, so that the blood shows better.
	Normal contestants are able to keep them down for up to 40 seconds.
The champion ferret legger, Reg Mellor, of Yorkshire, holds the world record
of 5 hours and 26 minutes.  Mr. Mellor's claims that being the champion is
not so much heroism but, "You just got to be able to have your tool bitten

Grownups are reluctant to take science fiction seriously, and with good
reason: sci-fi is a hormonal activity, not a literary one.  Its traditional
concerns are all pubescent.  Secondary sexual characteristics are everywhere,
disguised.  Aliens have tentacles.  Telepathy allows you to have sex without
any nasty inconvenience of touching.  Womblike spaceships provide balanced
meals.  No one ever has to grow old -- body parts are replaceable, like
Job's daughters, and if you're lucky you can become a robot.  As for the
adult world, it's simply not there; political systems tend to be naively
authoritarian (there are more lords in science fiction than on public
television) and are often ruled by young boys on quests.  The most popular
sci-fi book in years, Frank Herbert's Dune, sold millions of copies by
combining all these themes: it ends with its adolescent hero conquering the
universe while straddling a giant worm.

I walked on toward Ploughwright, thinking about feces.  What a lot we had
found out about the prehistoric past from the study of fossilized dung of
long-vanished animals.  A miraculous thing, really; a recovery from the
past from what was carelessly rejected.  And in the Middle Ages, how
concerned people who lived close to the world of nature were with the
feces of animals.  And what a variety of names they had for them: the
Crotels of a Hare, the Friants of a Boar, the Spraints of an Otter, the
Werderobe of a Badger, the Waggying of a Fox, the Fumets of a Deer.
Surely there might be some words for the material so near to the heart of

It is recounted that at King's College in the Strand around the time of the
war, the Chief of Services would inevitably begin the year's rounds by
teaching "a singularly important principle of medicine."  He asked a nurse
to fetch him a sample of urine.  He then talked at length about Diabetes
mellitus. "Diabetes," he said, "is a greek name; but the Romans noticed that
the bees like the urine of diabetics, so they added the word mellitus which
means sweet as honey.  Well, as you know, you may find sugar in the urine
of a diabetic ..."
	By now the nurse had returned with a sample of urine which the
registrar promptly held up like a trophy.  We stared at that straw-colored
fluid as if we had never seen such a thing before.  The registrar then
startled us.  He dipped a finger boldly into the urine, then licked his
finger with the tip of his tongue.  As if tasting wine, he opened and closed
his lips rapidly.  Could he perhaps detect a faint taste of sugar?  The sample
was passed on to us for an opinion.  We all dipped a finger into the fluid,
all of us foolishly licked that finger.
	"Now," said the Registrar grinning, "You have learnt the first
principle of diagnosis.  I mean the power of observation."  We were baffled.
We stood near the sluice room outside the ward, and in the distance, some
anonymous patient was explosively coughing. "You see," the registrar said
continuing triumphantly, "I dipped my MIDDLE finger into the urine, but
licked my INDEX finger -- not like all you chaps.

It was at the eighth annual mouse convention and mice from near and far had
gathered for the ball.  A pretty little female mouse waltzed by the stag
line and one of the males whistled a low, dirty whistle to himself.
Turning to  another mouse he said, "Look at the legs on that bitch, aren't
they beautiful?"
	"Just fair," was the answer.
	"You're crazy," said the first mouse and then turning to another,
asked his opinion.
	"They're nice," said the third mouse, "but nothing to get excited
about."
	"Some mice have no appreciation," exclaimed the first mouse.  "Now
you," he said to a fourth mouse, "what did you think?"
	"To tell you the truth," was the reply, "I'm no authority on legs;
I'm a tit mouse myself."

Joan, the rather well-proportioned secretary, spent almost all of
her vacation sunbathing on the roof of her hotel.  She wore a bathing suit
the frist day, but on the second, she decided that no one could see her
way up there, and she slipped out of it for an overall tan.  She'd hardly
begun when she heard someone running up the stairs; she was lying on her
stomach, so she just pulled a towel over her rear.
	"Excuse me, miss," said the flustered little assistant manager of
the hotel, out of breath from running up the stairs.  "The Hilton doesn't
mind your sunbathing on the roof, but we would very much appreciate your
wearing a bathing suit as you did yesterday."
	"What difference does it make," Joan asked rather calmly.  "No one
can see me up here, and besides, I'm covered with a towel."
	"Not exactly," said the embarrassed little man.  "You're lying on
the dining room skylight."

Konrad Lorenz, the great animal behaviorist, was scrupulous about cultivating
fruitful confusion.  Lorenz lived among his research subjects:  dozens of
species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes.  He did not quantify, control,
or consciously experiment.  He got to know each creature individually, then
threw them together, watching for the unexpected, the unusual, or the bizarre
in the chaos that followed.  For example, his interest in one of ethology's
most important concepts, that of intention movements (motions with meaning,
such as the head bobbing in birds that serves as an alarm signal before
flight), derived from an inadvertent experiment.  He had trained a free-flying
raven to eat raw meat from his hand and had been feeding the bird for several
hours one day.  He would reach into his pants pocket and take out a piece of
meat, and the raven would swoop down to grab it in its bill.  By and by, Lorenz
went to relieve himself near a hedge.  When the raven saw him put his hand
into his pants and pull out another morsel of meat, it swooped down, hungrily
grasping the new mouthful in its bill.  Lorenz howled in pain.  But the event
left a deep impression on him -- about how faithfully animals respond to
intention movements, that is.

Once in a medieval times...there was a King who was getting sort of
bored after dinner one night.  He decided to hold a contest of who at the
court had the mightiest "weapon".  The first knight stood up and proclaimed
that he had the mightiest weapon... he pulled down his pants and tied a 5
pound weight around it.  The weapon doth rose.  The crowds cheered... the
women swooned... the children waved multi-colored banners... and the band
played appropriate music.
	Another knight stood up and claimed that he had the mightiest weapon.
He dropped his pants and tied a 10 pound weight to himself.  The weapon doth
rose. The crowds cheered... the women swooned... the children waved
multi-colored banners...  and the band played appropriate music.
	After several more knights tried to prove their superiority...  the
King finally spoke out. "I have the mightiest weapon of them all!" He dropped
his pants and tied, not a 10 pound, not a 20 pound, not ever a thirty pound,
but a 40 pound weight, plus a coffe pot, to himself. The weapon doth rose.
The crowds cheered...  the women swooned... the children waved multi-colored
banners... and the band played "God Save the Queen."

One day a mouse was driving along the road in his Mercedes when he heard an
anguished roaring noise coming from the side of the road.  Stopping the car,
he got out and discovered a lion stuck in a deep ditch and roaring for help.
Reassuring the lion, the mouse tied a rope around the axle of the Mercedes,
threw the other end down to the lion, and pulled the beast out of the ditch.
The lion thanked the mouse profusely and they went their separate ways.
	Two months later the lion was out for a stroll in the country when
he heard a panicked squeaking coming from the side of the road.  Investigating
the noise, what should he come across but the mouse stuck in the same hole.
"Oh, please help me, Mr. Lion," squeaked the terrified mouse.  "I saved you
with my car once, remember?"
	"Course I'll help you, little fellow," roared the lion.  "I'll just
lower my dick down to you, you hold on to it, and we'll have you out of there
in a jiffy."  Sure enough, a few minutes later the mouse was high and dry on
the roadside, trying to convey his eternal gratitude to the lion.
	"Don't give it another thought," said the lion kindly.  "It just goes
to show that if you've got a big dick, you don't need a Mercedes."

Seems this fellow was suffering from terrific headaches, and went to his
doctor about it. The physician made a number of tests, and informed the man
that the only thing for his headaches was castration.  After a few more
months, the headaches became so intense that the man agreed to the operation.
Naturally enough, the ruination of his sex life depressed him tremendously,
and he decided to purchase a new wardrobe to make himself feel better.
He enters a men's clothing store and a salesman wanders over, looks him
up and down, and says, "Well, let's start with shirts... 15 neck, 34 sleeve."
	The guy is amazed.  "How'd you know?"
	"Well, I've been here nearly 30 years, and I can tell sizes within
a quarter inch on every piece of clothing."  The salesman's claim is borne
out.  Slacks, 34 waist, 32 inseam; jacket: 42 long.  And so on and so forth.
When the man has been completely outfitted he decides that he'd better buy
some new underwear.
	The salesman looks at him and says, "Okay, that'll be a 34."
	"No, that's wrong," says the man.  "I've always worn a 32."  The
salesman insists, pointing out his accuracy so far.  The man argues, agreeing
that while he's been right so far, he has always worn a 32 in shorts.
	Finally in exasperation, the salesman says, "Listen, I tell you,
you *have* to wear a 34.  Otherwise, you'll get these *awful* headaches."

have a special set of rules about visiting the lavatory.  Do you see this
little piece of string attached to my apron?"

comes in very handily.  I simply unzip my pants and take it out with that
piece of string.  That way everything stays sanitary."
	"But how do you put it back?"
	"Well, I don't know about the other guys," the waiter confided, "but

	The young male race horse came from a long line of winners, and did
wonderfully in time trials.  However, in actual races he proved a little too
romantic, and could never quite bring himself to pass a mare.
	So one day the trainer went to him and told him he'd have to be
castrated.  The young horse, knowing that it was either this or the glue
factory, took it philosophically.  After all, having the operation was
almost a certain guarantee of a long and illustrious racing career.
	After a short recovery period, the horse was again run in time
trials, and found to do as well as ever.  But the first time he actually
ran in a race, he only went about ten paces, before getting a dejected look
on his face, turning around, and ambling back to the starting gates.
	"What's the matter?" asked the trainer, "you were doing great!"

the road and into a telephone pole, totaling the car.
	The two stumbled out of the wreckage, both feeling quite fortunate
to be alive.  The Catholic crossed himself.  Then the Protestant crossed
himself in an accentuated manner.
	"Hey," said the Catholic, "I why did you cross yourself, you're not
Catholic!"
	"Just checking," replied his friend, crossing himself again,
"spectacles, testicles, wallet, pen."

A deep majestic voice answered,
	"Yes my son, I am here.  What do you need?"

Already the spirit of our schooling is permeated with the feeling that every
subject, every topic, every fact, every professed truth must be submitted
to a certain publicity and impartiality.  All proffered samples of learning
must go to the same assay-room and be subjected to common tests.  It is the
essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that any such "show-down" is
sacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristic of religion, from their point
of view, is that it is intellectually secret, not public; peculiarly revealed,
not generally known; authoritatively declared, not communicated and tested
in ordinary ways...It is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion
is conceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists,
there is something self-contradictory in speaking of education in religion
in the same sense in which we speak of education in topics where the method
of free inquiry has made its way.  The "religious" would be the last to be
willing that either the history of the content of religion should be taught
in this spirit; while those to whom the scientific standpoint is not merely
a technical device, but is the embodiment of the integrity of mind, must
protest against its being taught in any other spirit.

...and no philosophy, sadly, has all the answers.  No matter how assured
we may be about certain aspects of our belief, there are always painful
inconsistencies, exceptions, and contradictions.  This is true in religion
as it is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the
naive.  As for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we
might be advised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do
us the same courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever their
protestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clear
that they are easily disposed to restore to the sword.  My own belief in
God, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect
for Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the most
virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christians are
frustated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure of Jesus
because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.  Such ambiguity
is not apparent to children or fanatics, but every recognized Bible scholar
is perfectly aware of it.  Some Christians, alas, resort to formal lying to
obscure such reality.

As I argued in "Beloved Son", a book about my son Brian and the subject of
religious communes and cults, one result of proper early instruction in the
methods of rational thought will be to make sudden mindless conversions --
to anything -- less likely.  Brian now realizes this and has, after eleven
years, left the sect he was associated with.  The problem is that once the
untrained mind has made a formal commitment to a religious philosophy --
and it does not matter whether that philosophy is generally reasonable and
high-minded or utterly bizarre and irrational -- the powers of reason are
suprisingly ineffective in changing the believer's mind.

As the recent sightings of bumper stickers reading "IN CASE OF RAPTURE, THIS
VEHICLE WILL BE UNMANNED" have created a great deal of confusion, Fortune
offers the following excerpts from the 1989 printing of the State of Maryland
Driver's Handbook:
	If you notice a glorious light in the sky, a sound as of an infinite
choir of unearthly voices, and a host of winged beings descending from the
heavens, do not panic.  If you are on the freeway, move to the shoulder as
soon as it is safe to do so, activate your hazard blinkers, and wait for the
end of the world.  If you are Saved, it is especially important that you do
this BEFORE you are carried to your Eternal Reward, in order that your vehicle
not become a hazard to others.  Remember, Rapture is the number one cause of
automobile accidents during major spiritual upheavals.  You may experience a
feeling of discorporation ("being pulled from one's body") while driving.  To
ensure the safety of your passengers and other drivers, move to the shoulder
as soon as you notice any of the following symptoms:
	-- An overwhelming sense of peace and happiness.
	-- Visions of the faces of deceased family members.
	-- A glorious figure in white, beckoning from the end of a tunnel of
white mist (do not confuse this with traffic control or maintainance officers,
who wear dark blue and safety orange.)
	Once the feeling has passed, inspect your surroundings.  If still in
your car, you have probably suffered a stroke and should have someone drive
you to a hospital at once.  If you find yourself in the Kingdom of God, consult
the local officials for information on local traffic rules and regulations.

the small Gideon bibles.  The end capped off, a CO2 canister was connected
to provide up to 2,000 PSIG.  Prelimary estimates during field testing
revealed a muzzle velocity of approximarly 120-150 MPH for bibles exiting
the tube.  Sufficient ammunition was obtained during a previous visit to
campus by another religious organization, and the system was first used on
Brother Jim, who suffered a broken rib and numerous small bruises, in
addition to the usual humiliation.

God wants us to know that if we see a bumper sticker saying "Honk if you love

for being a turkey, for God told Man to be fruitful and multiply, and to rule
over the beasts of the field and the birds of the air, and that includes the
turkeys who buy such bumper stickers.  Of course, God understands that innocent
bystanders will also be annoyed, but He has wisely created traffic cops to
impose some constraint on how much we may annoy the turkeys within city limits,

dilemmas shall be fewer in number in the future, when the generations a-coming

expected, and may be with us for a long time yet.

However, on religious issues there can be little or no compromise.  There

There is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than Jesus Christ,
or God, or Allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being.  But like any
powerful weapon, the use of God's name on one's behalf should be used
sparingly.  The religious factions that are growing throughout our land are
not using their religious clout with wisdom.  They are trying to force
government leaders into following their position 100 percent.  If you disagree

don't allow demonstrable truth to get in the way of their beliefs.  In
addition to creation science and the flatness of the earth, the
following beliefs have been certified by Pope Duane as Church dogma:

    --  That sex can be enjoyed only by blacks and homosexuals.
    --  That Billy Joe Wilson (Hoopla, Miss.) has successfully squared
        the circle.
    --  That Harry Truman is still president, and doing a fine job.

It seems that a rabbi, a priest and a minister decided to go fishing one
sunny afternoon.  All three climbed into the boat and headed for the middle
of the lake.  After several hours of relaxation, the minister decided that
"nature was calling", and climbed out of the boat and walked ashore.  In
a few moments, he walked back out to the boat and climbed back in.
	The rabbi was absolutely astonished, but decided not to mention
the apparent miracle.
	A few minutes later, the priest also decided to go ashore for a
moment, and climbed out of the boat, walked to shore, and a few minutes
later came back.
	By now the rabbi was in great distress and had begun to doubt his
beliefs and wonder if there might be some validity to the Christian
teachings.  But he immediately reaffirmed the fact that his faith WAS JUST
AS STRONG as either the priest's or the minister's and decided that anything
they could do, with God's help, he could do as well.
	The rabbi then announced that he needed relief and would walk to
shore.  He climbed out of the boat and went straight to the bottom of the
lake.  While the rabbi was thrashing about in the water, the priest turned to
the minister and said, "So... do you think we ought to tell him where the
rocks are?"

It seems that there was this Christian about to be thrown to the lions.  He
was shoved into the middle of the arena and the lion was released.  Being
a good Christian, as the lion approached he knelt and prayed, asking God for
forgiveness for his (few) sins, and begging that the lion might be dissuaded
from eating him for its breakfast.  Much to his dismay, the lion didn't stop
but kept coming, getting faster and faster, now almost running, so the
Christian took off too.  There they were, running around and around the arena,
the lion getting closer and the Christian praying harder and harder between
gasps for breath.  The lions breath was now hot upon his heels and he could
even feel droplets of the lions saliva splashing on his bare feet.  So he
pulled out all the stops, promising God that if the lion will only spare him,
he will devote the rest of his life to spreading the Christian faith,

Slowing to a stop, he turned around and saw the lion on its knees, eyes rolled

the Christian approached until he could make out what the lion was saying.

Little Herbie had been blind since birth.  One day at bedtime, his mother
told him that the next day was a very special one.  If he prayed extra
hard, he'd be able to see when he woke up the next morning.  The next
morning she came into Herbie's room and asked him if he'd prayed hard
the night before.
	"Yes, Mommie," was his reply, "all night long!"
	"Well, then," she said, "open your eyes and you'll know that
your prayers have been answered."

Newsflash:
	Apparently the rapture did occur last Tuesday as was originally
predicted.  All true believers were transported to heaven while the rest
of us were left behind to await the Anti-Christ and the end of the world.
	Widespread reports that the rapture had not occurred stemmed from
expectations that the effect would be more widespread than it turned out
to be.  The definition of "true believer" was apparently more restrictive
than expected, however, and the only qualifiers were a family of five,
living in Stenton, North Dakota.

Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-
bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers
have chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the non-existence
of God.  The argument follows:  "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God,
"for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."  "But," says Man,
"the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it?  It could not have evolved
by chance, thus proving that you exist, therefore by your own arguements,
you don't.  QED."  "Oh, dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and
promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.

Seems like these four rabbis had a series of theological arguments, and three
were always in accord against the fourth.  One day, the odd rabbi out, with
the usual "3 to 1, majority rules" statement that signified that he had lost
again, decided to appeal to a higher authority.  "Oh, God!" he cried.  "I
know in my heart that I am right and they are wrong!  Please show me a sign,
so they too will know that I understand Your laws."
	It was a beautiful, sunny day.  As soon as the rabbi finished his
plaint, a storm cloud moved across the sky above the four.  It rumbled once
and dissolved.  "A sign from God!  See, I'm right, I knew it!"  But the other
three disagreed, pointing out that stormclouds form on hot days.
	So he asked again: "Oh, God, I need a bigger sign to show that I am
right and they are wrong.  So please, God, a bigger sign."
	This time four stormclouds appeared, rushed toward each other to form
one big cloud, and a bolt of lightning knocked down a tree ten feet away from
the rabbis.  The cloud dispersed at once.  "I told you I was right!" insisted
the loner, but the others insisted that nothing had happened that could not
be explained by natural causes.
	The insisting rabbi is all ready to ask for a *very big* sign when
just as he says "Oh God..." the sky turns pitch black, the earth shakes, and
a deep, booming voice intones, "HEEEEEEEE'S RIIIIIIIGHT!"
	The sky returns to normal.  The one rabbi puts his hands on his hips
and snarls, "Well?"  "Okay, okayyyy," replied another, "so now it's 3 to 2!"

Seems like this farmer purchased an old, run-down, abandoned farm with plans
to turn it into a thriving enterprise.  The fields are grown over with weeds,
the farmhouse is falling apart, and the fences are collapsing all around.
During his first day of work, the town preacher stops by to bless the man's
work, praying, "May you and God work together to make this the farm of your
dreams!"
	A few months later, the preacher stops by again to call on the farmer.
Lo and behold, it's like a completely different place -- the farm house is
completely rebuilt and in excellent condition, there is plenty of cattle and
other livestock happily munching on feed in well-fenced pens, and the fields
are filled with crops planted in neat rows.  "Amazing!" the preacher says.
"Look what God and you have accomplished together!"
	"Yes, reverend," replies the farmer, "but remember what the farm was
like when God was working it alone!"

Sixtus V, Pope from 1585 to 1590 authorized a printing of the Vulgate
Bible.  Taking no chances, the pope issued a papal bull automatically
excommunicating any printer who might make an alteration in the text.
This he ordered printed at the beginning of the Bible.  He personally
examined every sheet as it came off the press.  Yet the published
Vulgate Bible contained so many errors that corrected scraps had to be
printed and pasted over them in every copy.  The result provoked wry
comments on the rather patchy papal infallibility, and Pope Sixtus had
no recourse but to order the return and destruction of every copy.

sublime confession: Credo quia absurdum est (I believe because it is absurd).
This does not altogether accord with historical fact, for he merely said:

	is absurd.  And buried he rose again, which is certain because it
	is impossible."
Thanks to the acuteness of his mind, he saw through the poverty of

to commit adultery.

The somewhat old and crusty vicar was taking a well-earned retirement from

vestments, but lead the service wearing a nice 2-piece suit.  The congregation
was horrified!  He changed the order of the service.  The congregation was
horrified!  Then came the children's lesson.

This story concerns a man who, after putting his son to bed each night, would
stand by his boy's door and listen to his son saying his prayers.  One night,
the boy ended his prayers with, "God specially bless Granddad, who won't be
with us much longer."  The man thought this was rather curious, but passed it
off as childish whimsy.  The next day, however, he received a call from his
mother, informing him that his father had passed away early that morning.
During the next few weeks, he listened particularly closely to his son's
prayers, but noticed nothing unusual.  Then, one night, the boy ended his
prayers with, "God specially bless Grandmom, who won't be with us much longer."
Although the shock of the original incident had worn off during the intervening
weeks, he nontheless phoned his mother to inquire as to her health.  He went to
bed reassured, only to be awakened in the night by his sister calling with the
news that their mother had died suddenly in the night.  The father had a series
of psychological tests done; nothing unusual was uncovered.  About a month 
later, the boy ended his prayers with, "God specially bless Daddy, who won't
be with us much longer."  The man was panic-stricken, certain that he was 
going to die during the night.  He resolved to stay awake all night; if awake 
and alert he should be able to prevent any tragedy.  Morning came.  Breathing
a huge sigh of relief, he went to get the paper off the porch.  There, lying
dead on the doorstep, was the milkman.

themselves about their relationship to God.  But all will agree on a
proposition that they possess profound spiritual resources.  If, in addition,
we can get them to accept the further proposition that whatever form the Deity
may have in their own theology, the Deity is not only external, but internal
and acts through them, and they themselves give proof or disproof of the
Deity in what they do and think; if this further proposition can be accepted,
then we come that much closer to a truly religious situation on earth.

Well, you see there was this neighborhood that had a priest, a minister, and
a rabbi who lived near each other.  One summer afternoon the priest went out
and bought himself a new car, and the minister and rabbi, not to be outdone,
did the same.
	The next day the priest went out and blessed his car.  The minister
hired a crane and baptized his car in a swimming pool.  The rabbi, after
thinking seriously for a bit, got a hacksaw and cut three inches off the end
of the tail pipe.

What is good?  Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the
will to power, power itself.  What is bad?  Everything that is born of
weakness.  Not contentedness but more power; not peace but war; not virtue
but fitness.  The weak and the failures shall perish: first principle of
our love of man.  And they shall even be given every possible assistance.
What is more harmful than any vice?  Active pity for all the failures and
all the weak: Christianity.

Why, when no honest man will deny in private that every ultimate problem is
wrapped in the profoundest mystery, do honest men proclaim in pulpits that
unhesitating certainty is the duty of the most foolish and ignorant?  Is it
not a spectacle to make the angels laugh?  We are a company of ignorant
beings, feeling our way through mists and darkness, learning only be
incessantly repeated blunders, obtaining a glimmering of truth by falling
into every conceivable error, dimly discerning light enough for our daily
needs, but hopelessly differing whenever we attempt to describe the ultimate
origin or end of our paths; and yet, when one of us ventures to declare that
we don't know the map of the universe as well as the map of our infintesimal
parish, he is hooted, reviled, and perhaps told that he will be damned to all
eternity for his faithlessness.

A beachcomber of 25 had been shipwrecked on a desert island since the age of
six.  One day, while in search of food, he stumbled across a beautifully
sensuous female lying on the beach nearly naked; she'd been washed ashore from
another shipwreck that morning.  After they got over their initial surprise
at seeing each other, the girl wanted to know how long he had been alone on
this barren bit of land.
	"Almost twenty years," he answered.
	"Twenty years!" she exclaimed.  "But how ever did you survive?"
	"Oh, I fish, dig for clams, and gather berries and coconuts," he
replied.
	"And what do you do for sex?" she asked.
	"What's that?"  He looked puzzled.
	Whereupon the maiden pulled the innocent young man down onto the sand
beside her and proceeded to demonstrate.  After they had finished, she asked
how he had enjoyed it.
	"Great!" was the reply.  "But look what it did to my clamdigger!"

A beautiful, voluptous woman goes to see a gynecologist.  The doctor takes
one look at this woman and his professionalism is a thing of the past.  Right
away he tells her to undress.  After she has disrobed he begins to stroke her
thigh.  As he does this he says to the woman, "Do you know what I'm doing?"
	"Yes," she says, "you're checking for any abrasions or dermatological
abnormalities."
	"Correct," says the doctor.  He then begins to fondle her breasts.
"Do you know what I'm doing now?" he says.
	"Yes," says the woman, "you're checking for any lumps or breast
cancer."
	"That's right," replies the doctor.  He then gradually proceeds to
having sexual intercourse with her.  "Do you know," he pants, "what I'm doing
now?"
	"Yes," she says.  "You're getting herpes."

probably just waited until I left so she could meet with her lover."
	When he gets to his office, he calls home.  The maid answers.  He
says, "Hello.  Is my wife there?"
	"Yes, sir", the maid whispers.
	"Is she with her lover?"
	The maid pauses, and then says, "Yes, sir, she is, and I must say
that I feel terrible about how she treats you."
	The man yells, "That no good **#*&!!.  If you feel as badly as you
say you do, you must do this for me: go to my dresser and get my gun.  Check

two-timing whore and her lover.  Dispose of the gun, and then come back to
the phone and tell me that it's over.  Don't worry -- I'll protect you."
The man hears footsteps, a drawer being opened, a click, more footsteps,
silence... and then two shots.  More footsteps.  Finally the maid comes back
to the phone and says "It's done."
	The man asks, "What did you do with the gun?"
	"I threw it behind the statue in the garden", the maid replies.

A drunk was sitting at the end of the bar in a popular single's place,

moments with each woman.  As he worked his way closer, while he couldn't

A farmer decides that his three sows should be bred, and contacts a
buddy down the road, who owns several boars.  They agree on a stud fee, and
the farmer puts the sows in his pickup and takes them down the road to the
boars.  He leaves them all day, and when he picks them up that night, asks
the man how he can tell if it "took" or not.  The breeder replies that if,
the next morning, the sows were grazing on grass, they were pregnant, but if
they were rolling in the mud as usual, they probably weren't.
	Comes the morn, the sows are rolling in the mud as usual, so the
farmer puts them in the truck and brings them back for a second full day of
frolic.  This continues for a week, since each morning the sows are rolling
in the mud.
	Around the sixth day, the farmer wakes up and tells his wife, "I

today."  With that, the wife peeks out the bedroom window and starts to laugh.

A hunter saved a native boy from a boa constrictor.  In gratitude, the boy gave
the hunter a magic gorilla prick.  The lad said the prick would do anything you
told it to do until you told it to do something else.  When the hunter returned
home to England, he put the magic gorilla prick on the mantle along with some
of his other trophies.  His wife thought it quaint and his story charming.  But
soon, the hunter went a-safariing again.  He was away for months.  One evening,
the woman eyed the MGP carefully and whispered, "Gorilla Prick, fuck me."
Whereupon the thing jumped off the mantle and began to bang her with great
thoroughness and ferocity.  For the first twenty minutes it was pure heaven,
but after the next few minutes it became fatiguing, and she said, "Stop it,
Gorilla Prick," but it didn't.  After a bit more she was screaming "Stop!

A nubile female virtually never experiences difficulty in finding willing
sexual partners, and in a natural habitat nubile females are probably always
married.  The basic female "strategy" is to obtain the best possible husband,
to be fertilized by the fittest available male (always, of course, taking
risk into account), and to maximize the returns on sexual favors bestowed:
to be sexually aroused by the sight of males would promote random matings,
thus undermining all of these aims, and would also waste time and energy
that could be spent in economically significant activities and in nurturing
children.  A female's reproductive success would be seriously compromised
by the propensity to be sexually aroused by the sight of males.

A performing octopus could play the piano, the zither and a piccolo, and his
trainer wanted him to add the bagpipe to his accomplishments.  With this in
mind, a bagpipe was placed in the octopus's room, and the trainer awaited
results.  Hours passed, but no bagpipe music was heard.  Since the talented
octopus usually learned quickly, the trainer was disturbed.  Opening the door
the next morning, he asked the octopus,
	"Have you learned to play that thing yet?"
	"Play it!" retorted the octopus. "I've been trying to lay it all
night!"

A policeman is walking his beat when he finds an inebriated man collapsed
against a building, weeping uncontrollably and holding his car keys in his
hands.  He's moaning something about how "They took my car!"  Seeing that
the man is well-dressed, the officer suspects that he may have a real case
of theft on his hands and attempts to question the man.
	"What happened to your car?"
	"My car, it was right on the end of my key, and those bastards
stole it!  Please officer, get my Porsche back.  My God, it was right on
the end of my key!  Where is it?  They stole it and it was right here;

	A proper elderly English couple visiting Australia decided to hire a
car to take a look at the outback.  "We know it's rough country, but it's safe
and decent, isn't it?" the husband inquired of the rental-agency manager.
Upon being assured that it was, the couple drove off.
	Later that day, they returned, upset and angry.  "You said it was
decent country," the Englishwoman upbraided the rental agent, "but we hadn't
driven too far when we saw a man in a field copulating with a kangaroo!"
	"And not too long after that," complained her husband, "a one-legged
aborigine leaning against a tree by the side of the road grinningly waved
at us with one hand while he brazenly masturbated himself with the other!"
	"Guv'nor," responded the Aussie, "yer wouldn't expect a poor bugger
like that, with only one leg, to catch a 'roo, would you?"

A shy young man, preparing himself for what he hoped would be the ultimate sex
act with a pretty young lady, went into a drugstore to inquire about sizes and
styles of condoms.  The lusty proprietress, a buxom widow, saw an opportunity
for fun at the lad's expense.
	"Come in the back and try some on for size," she said, taking his hand.
The widow unzipped the youth's fly and watched the small instrument grow in
her hand as she measured it.  When the weapon had unfurled to a rosy seven and
a half inches, the young man, unable to contain himself, had an orgasm with a
tremendous discharge.  After recovering, he asked the widow if she could now
give him the proper size.
	"I'll do more than that," she said.  "I'll give you free meals and a

	A strange looking white man came to the Indian reservation looking
for a job.  He asked to talk to the Chief of the tribe, so he might give his
qualifications.  The Chief strode forward from the group surrounding the
white man and said: "You leave!  No job!"
	The man explained that this was no ordinary job he was seeking, but
that of tribe Medicine-Man.  He would convince him if the Chief would allow
him to demonstrate his magic.  "No magic!" said the disbelieving Chief.
	"Oh, yeah?", said the stranger.  "I'll prove it to you by making
your dog, here, talk!"
	"Dog, no talk!" responded the Chief, but before he could finish, he
heard a voice coming out of the mouth of the dog saying, "The Chief treats me
good.  He feeds me, and keeps me in teepee when it snows!"
	"If you still have doubts as to my magic," continued the stranger,
"the next voice you'll hear will be that of your horse!"
	"Horse, no talk!" argued the still-sceptical Chief, but again he
heard a voice that said: "I am the Chief's favorite horse.  He takes me up to
the green pasture to eat and brushes my coat when I get dirty."
	The stranger, still seeing some disbelieving faces, claimed for his
final trick he would make the Chief's sheep talk.

A stranger had just arrived in the mining town and was spending the evening at
the local saloon.  After a few drinks, he mentioned to the bartender that he

	The bartender replied, "Nope.  Ain't no women in this town!"
	"No women? What do the men do for... er..."
	"Oh, for sex?  Did you see all those pigs in the street?  That's the
answer, right there."
	Shaking his head incredulously, the stranger settled back to his
drinking.  Within a short time, however, the liquor had convinced him that he
wanted to try out a pig himself.  He had watched several miners walk upstairs
to the trysting rooms with squealing piglets under their arms.  Now, he was
game to make his move.  He wandered out to the back of the saloon and chose
a nice fat, pink sow.  As he walked to the stairs, the entire saloon went

A young woman was afflicted with three brothers who had a friendly competition
as to who was the best practical joker.  When she announced her marriage,
like all good brothers, they immediately found out where the honeymoon would

After Joan and Max had been married for 25 years, Max became disinterested
in sex, and his libido began to wan dramatically.  In desperation, Joan
hauled him to a marriage couselor, who listened patiently to Joan's complaints
and Max's protestations.  Max claimed that he was being nagged unmercifully
to fulfill Joan's needs, and that after awhile every marriage tended to
become less physical.  Joan said that that wasn't true and that she had
needs and desires that he, as her husband, was expected to fulfill.  Finally,
the counselor issued the verdict. "Max," he said, "Everybody has to give a
little for a marriage to work.  From now on, no matter how you feel at the
time, you must give Joan her conjugal rights at least semi-annually.  And,
remember, do it in a loving, considerate manner; after all, you and your
wife are a partnership of love."  Joan was delighted, and floated out of the
counselor's offices.  On the way downstairs, she nudged Max.

An Aggie was appointed ambassador to Japan.  Two weeks before
officially reporting to the embassy, he went from geisha house to geisha
house.  While making love to a geisha girl, he heard her repeat, "Yaki-san,
yaki-san."

	When he reported to the embassy, he received his first assignment,
which was to escort the prime minister of Japan around the golf course.
After having played a couple of holes, the prime minister teed-off and made
a hole-in-one.  The prime minister jumped up and down shouting, "Bonsai!

tells the woman the he will grant her any three wishes her heart desires.
	After a bit of thought, she says, "I wish I were young and

	After a little more thought, she says, "I would like to be rich
for the rest of my life."  And POOF!  When the smoke clears, there are
stacks and stacks of money lying on the porch.

	"Well," says the woman, "I would like for you to transform my
faithful old cat, whom I have loved dearly for fifteen years, into a young
handsome prince!"
	And with another billow of smoke the cat is changed into a tall,

And having stretched me out upon his bed with my head a little to one side,
he sat down next to me and raised my head upon his lap.  He peered avidly at
me, his eyes seemed ready to devour the secretion oozing from my nose.  "Oh,
the pretty little snotface," said he, beginning to pant, "How I'm going to
suck her."  Therewith bending down over me, and taking my nose in his mouth,
not only did he devour all the mucus between my nose and mouth, but he even
lewdly darted the tip of his tongue into each of my nostrils, one after the
other, and with such cleverness he provoked two or three sneezes which
redoubled the flow he desired and was consuming so hungrily.  But ask me for
no details bearing upon this fellow, Messieurs, nothing appeared, and whether
because he did nothing, or becaues he did it all in his drawers, there was
nothing to be seen, and amidst the multitude of his kisses and lecherous
lickings there was nothing outstanding which might have denoted an ecstasy,
and consequently it is my opinion that he did not discharge.  All my clothes
were in place, even his hands stayed still, and I give you my word that this

and least initiated girl without her being able to suppose there was anything
lewd in it at all.

As you know, birds do not have sexual organs because they would interfere
with flight.  [In fact, this was the big breakthrough for the Wright
Brothers.  They were watching birds one day, trying to figure out how to get
their crude machine to fly, when suddenly it dawned on Wilbur.  "Orville,"
he said, "all we have to do is remove the sexual organs!" You should have
seen their original design.] As a result, birds are very, very difficult to
arouse sexually.  You almost never see an aroused bird.  So when they want
to reproduce, birds fly up and stand on telephone lines, where they monitor
telephone conversations with their feet.  When they find a conversation in
which people are talking dirty, they grip the line very tightly until they
are both highly aroused, at which point the female gets pregnant.

Attracted by repeated newspaper advertisements, and realizing that
his waist had gone both East and West despite his daily racquetball, a young
executive appeared at a local health resort.  Looking over the several weight
loss plans offered, he selected one guaranteed to reduce his weight by two
pounds per day.  After a light breakfast, and a almost non-existent lunch, he
was escorted to a large room, where a young, attractive woman told him that
"if he caught her, he could have her".  After an hour of hard running, he
finally gave up; and weighing himself, was comforted to realize that he had
lost just under three pounds.  Returning the next week, he chose the plan that
was to reduce his weight by four pounds per session.  After following the same
regimen, he was again escorted to a large room, but after two hours of running,
he caught the young woman.  Weight loss, just over four pounds.  Returning the
following week, he chose to lose eight pounds in a single day.  He was shown
to the largest room he'd seen, by far, where he was confronted by a extremely
muscular, burly man, who looked him square in the eye, flung his towel into
a corner, and snarled, "You know the rules.  Start running!"

	"NOT GETTING ANY, BETTER COME HOME AT ONCE."

Desperate because her husband hadn't made love to her in months, a lonely
housewife finally mustered her courage and went to their doctor for advice.
The doctor was very sympathetic and wrote out a prescription for pills that
were guaranteed to rekindle the husband's ardor in a big way.  "They'll make
him horny as hell," the doctor confided, "but they're very potent, so just
put one in whatever he's drinking."
	Upon arriving home, the woman left the pills on the kitchen counter
and dashed off to the supermarket.  It didn't take long before the cat jumped
up, knocked them over onto the floor, and ate a couple, as did the family
dog.  And when the husband got home with a headache, he took a few thinking
they were aspirin.
	When the housewife returned, she was horrified to see the dog humping
the cat and the cat jumping all over the dog, but even stranger was the sight
of her husband with his penis inside the pencil sharpener on the counter.
"What in heaven's name are you doing, John?" she cried.
	"See that mosquito?" he replied.

while they were short of beds, he could sleep with his daughter.  She proved 
to be eighteen and beautiful.   So they went to bed, and shortly, Ed made a 
pass at the daughter.  "Stop that!" she said.  "I'll call my father."  
	He desisted.  But half an hour later he made another attempt.  "Uh, 
stop ... that," she said.  "I'll call my father."
	But she moved closer to him, so he made a third try.  This time, no
protest, no threat.  Just as Ed, satisfied, was about to drowse off, she 
tugged at his pajama sleeve.  "Could we do that again?" she asked.  
	Ed obliged, and this time fell asleep only to be awakened by the 
tug at his sleeve.  "Again?"  
	And again Ed obliged.  But when his sleep was once more interrupted
by the tugging at his pajama sleeve, Ed indignantly pulled it away from her
and mumbled, "Stop that!  Or I'll call your father."

FORTUNE DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN:	#15

Sex:
	Women prefer 30-40 minutes of foreplay.  Men prefer 30-40 seconds of
foreplay.  Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.

Maturity:
	Women mature much faster than men.  Most 17-year-old females can
function as adults.  Most 17-year-old males are still trading baseball cards
and giving each other wedgies after gym class.  This is why high school
romances rarely work out.

Handwriting:
	To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship.  They just
chicken-scratch.  Women use scented, colored stationary and they dot their
"i's" with circles and hearts.  Women use ridiculously large loops in their
"p's" and "g's".  It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman.  Even
when she's dumping you, she'll put a smiley face at the end of the note.

FORTUNE DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN:	#18

Sexual frequency:
	The average man would prefer having sex every evening, or every
morning, or maybe both if he's under 25.  The average woman would like to
have sex non-stop all weekend, once a month.

Shopping:
	It's no coincidence that L.L. Bean, Sears, and Roebuck were all men.
Men don't like to shop.  If a man can't foist the job off on some woman, he
will grit his teeth and plan the outing as he would a jungle expedition.
He wants a map of the store showing where he has to go to get item X in
color Y in the correct size, which he doesn't know.  Even then it takes him
half an hour to get there from the entrance.  When he's finally accomplished
his mission, he'll discover that he forgot his checkbook.  Women shop to
relax.

find a pathetically unattractive woman sleeping blissfully beside him.  He
leaped out of bed, dressed quickly, and furtively placed $100 on top of the

another female even homelier than the one he'd left in bed.  She gazed up

God built a compelling sex drive into every creature, no matter

wildly joyous, free from fears.  He made it innocent merriment.

agreed, from aardvarks to zebras.  All the jolly animals -- lions and
lambs, rhinoceroses and gazelles, skylarks and lobsters, even insects,
though most of them fuck only once in a lifetime -- fucked along
innocently and merrily for hundreds of millions of years.  Maybe they

No matter how bad the situation, he would always say, "Well, it could have

	To cure him of his annoying habit, his friends decided to invent a
situation so completely black, so dreadful, that even Harry could find no

"Harry!  Did you hear what happened to George?  He came home last night,
found his wife in bed with another man, shot them both, and then turned
the gun on himself!"
	"Terrible," said Harry.  "But it could have been worse."

nor when she bought the dress, nor when they picked the time and place.
All he kept saying was, "Darling, I've got a big surprise for you," at which
she blushed and smiled bewitchingly.
	The wedding came and went, and the young couple were at last alone
in their honeymoon suite. "Now don't forget, Harry, you promised me a big
surprise," smiled the bride.

leg, slipped into bed, and placed his wife's hand on the stump.

	After the man downed a foul-tasting potion, the gypsy said, "There.
Now the words beep-beep will give you an enormous erection.  Repeating
the phrase will make it disappear.  But remember," she cautioned, "it will
work only three times.  Make use of them wisely."

he said, and sure enough, he got the biggest erection of his life.
"Beep-beep", he repeated.  It went away.

He had heard that a certain whorehouse had a reputation for the bizarre.
So he drove to the place and, once inside, asked the Madam if she had anything
unusual for him to try.  "Things are pretty slow today," she said, "but I
do have one number you might enjoy."  She went on to describe a New Jersey
hen that had been trained to do blow jobs.
	"We've got her here, but only for the day."
	The visitor could hardly believe it, but he paid the fee and went
into a room with a hen.  After a frustrating hour of trying to force his
cock into the hen's mouth, he figured out that he was dealing with nothing
but a plain old chicken.  He left.  Thinking about it later, he decided
that he had had so much fun trying that he returned the few days later and
asked the Madam, "Do you have anything new today?"
	"Come this way," she said, and led him to a dark room where a group
of men were looking through a one-way mirror.  He saw that they were watching
a girl making it with a large doberman pinscher.

HOT TUB TIPS FOR WOMEN
	Vol. I -- Etiquette

1. It's not lady-like to straddle a water jet, moan in ecstasy, and then
	scream at the top of your lungs, "Oh, yes, YES, BABY!"
2. Washing your partner's back is sexy.  Washing your panty hose is not.
3. Nude bathing with strangers can be a pleasant experience; don't spoil
	it for everyone with a thoughtless remark, such as "My God, I've
	seen bigger wangs on hamsters!"
4. It's O.K. to pass a joint while tubbing.  Don't pass anything else.
5. Don't think you're fooling anybody by passing off your vibrator as a
	toy submarine.

Most fish live underwater, which is a terrible place to have sex because
virtually anywhere you lie down there will be stinging crabs and large
quantities of little fish staring at you with buggy little eyes.  So
generally when two fish want to have sex, they swim around and around for
hours, looking for someplace to go, until finally the female gets really
tired and has a terrible headache, and she just dumps her eggs right on the
sand and swims away.  Then the male, driven by some timeless, noble instinct
for survival, eats the eggs.  So the truth is that fish don't reproduce at
all, but there are so many of them that it doesn't make any difference.

Mrs. Johnson had a very beautiful and intelligent parrot.  He had just one

time and time again, but he would just laugh at her.  Finally, she told him
that if he did it again, she would cut off all of the feathers on the top of
his head.  Well, he resisted the urge for a week, but one day, he just
couldn't resist going next door.  Besides, he figured she was bluffing.
	Well, Mr. Hawkins came over, ranting and raving about how the parrot
had been fucking his chickens again.  Mrs. Johnson didn't say a word, just
took out her scissors and cut off all of the parrot's head feathers.
	That night, Mrs. Johnson had a big party at her house.  Before it
started, she took the parrot and put him on top of the piano by the front
door.  "Since you disobeyed me today, you have to stay here on the piano
tonight.  Now, don't you dare move."
	Well, the parrot was pretty pissed off about having his head bare,
and he wasn't too happy about having to spend the whole evening on the piano.
Still, as he usually did, when the butler would announce the guests as they
arrived, he would say hello to them.  Just then, two bald-headed men came to
the door.
	Before the butler could say anything, the parrot yelled, "Okay, you

Of course, I speak of nothing else but that classic of understated yet wildly
exciting eroticism, "The Windflower," by Laura London.  Ms. London is the
author of such other philosophical block-busters as "Bad Baron's Daughter,"
"A Heart Too Proud," "Moonlight Mist," and most thigh-warming of all, "Gypsy
Heiress".  Well, glasses-steaming scenes are to be found on every page, to
an extent which overwhelms Your Humble Narrator, and so, in order to save
himself extreme embarrassment, he brings you... the blurb:

	"Every lady of breeding knows: no one has a good time on a pirate
ship.  No one, that is, but the pirates.  Yet there she was, Merry Wilding
-- kidnapped in error, taken from a ship bound from New York to England,
spirited away in a barrel and swept aboard the infamous "Black Joke"...
There she was, trembling with pleasure in the arms of her achingly handsome,
sensationally sensual, golden-haired captor -- Devon."

Once upon a time there was a farmer who had borrowed a bull to service his
two cows.  He put all three animals on a meadow and sent little Johnny to
observe and report any success.  A short time later, little Johnny came
running towards the house shouting: "Daddy, Daddy, the bull just fucked the
white cow!"
	The father took little Johnny aside and said: "Look, kid, it's
alright if you use that kind of language around me, but the reverend is
going to be visiting soon.  So next time, please use another word; just
say that the bull "surprised" the cow."
	Johnny agreed and went back to observe any progress.  A little
while later, while the preacher was talking to the farmer, little Johnny
came a-running again, shouting: "Daddy, Daddy!"
	The father, trying to avoid embarrassing the preacher, said: "I
know, the bull surprised the brown cow."
	Little Johnny replied: "He sure did, he fucked the white one again!"

Once upon a time there was a farmer who owned a large number of chickens and
made money by selling chickens to a local distributing company.  The farmer
wanted to increase his business, and so went to market to buy another rooster.
"This rooster," assured the vendor, "is my best.  He's virile and energetic 
and will take care of all your chickens!"  The farmer, delighted at this, 
bought the rooster and returned to his farm.  He set the rooster loose among 
his hen houses and, sure enough, the rooster enthusiastically went to work. 
It wasn't too long, however, before the rooster finished off all the hens and 
began on the few geese and ducks that were on the farm.  "If you keep up this 
rate," warned the farmer, "you'll screw yourself to death!"  The rooster, 
however, scoffed at the farmer and continued at an increased speed.  The next 
morning, the farmer was doing his chores when he noticed several buzzards in 
the sky circling over something.  He headed out behind the barn, and sure 
enough there was the rooster, flat on his back, with eyes closed.  The farmer 
shook his fist at the motionless body and cursed, shouting "I knew it!  I told 
you so!  I knew you'd screw yourself to death!"  The rooster turned his head 
toward the farmer, opened one eye, and winked.  "Shhh!" he said, pointing to 
the birds above.  "I think they're coming down."

Once upon a time there was a little girl named Little Red Riding Hood.  One
fine morning she decided to visit her Grandmother, so she put a freshly baked

she got there, what should she find but a big black wolf in the bed, who
jumped up, grabbed her and snarled, "I'm going to fuck you until the sun goes

enough to ask Stanley why he exercised all day.  Stanley said,
	"Look, only one sperm gets a woman pregnant and when the right
time comes, I am going to be that one."
A few days later, the all felt themselves getting hotter and hotter, and they
knew that it was getting to be their time to go.  They were released abruptly
and, sure enough, there was Stanley swimming far ahead of all the others.
All of a sudden, Stanley stopped, turned around, and began to swim back with

One day a city dweller decided to take a ride in the country.  He hopped
into his sportscar, wandered along the highway for a while and then exited
to some very rural dirt roads in the middle of farm country.  After awhile,
he came across a farmer who clearly working his fields.  The funny thing was,
the farmer didn't seem to be wearing any pants.  The man got out of his car
and approached the farmer.
	"Hey, buddy," he asked, "how come you're not wearing any clothes?"
	Replied the farmer, "Well, boy, th' other day I was out a-workin'

that night, and mah neck was stiffer than a oak-wood board.  This here's

One day Adam, while wandering around the Garden of Eden, noticed that all
the animals seemed to come in pairs, male and female.  He also noted that
they seemed to enjoy being together a lot.  So, he went to his special
place and reported to God what he'd noticed.
	God, understanding his need, said, "Adam, the time has come for me
to provide you with a mate.  Go lie down and when you have fallen asleep, I
will create your mate."
	So Adam wandered off, found a nice patch of soft grass and fell
asleep.  Some time later he awoke, possibly due to a bit of pain in his
ribs, possibly because of the gorgeous woman leaning over him.  Remembering
the animals he'd seen having such fun, he immediately reached for her.

little dog.
	What a lovely picture, thought the Father to himself.  Walking over,
he asked, "Child, what is your name?"
	"Blossom," she replied.
	"What a fitting name," exclaimed Father O'Malley.  "And how did your
parents come to choose such a pretty name?"
	"Well, one day when I was still in my mommy's tummy she was lying
under this very tree when a blossom fell and landed on her stomach.  She
thought it was a message from God and decided that I would be a girl and my
name would be Blossom," explained the little girl sweetly.
	How charming, thought the priest.  He started to say good-bye and
walk away, then turned back.  "And the name of your little dog?" he
inquired.
	"Porky," was the child's reply.
	Again he asked her how the unusual name had been chosen.
	"Because he likes to fuck pigs."

One night when his charge was pretty high, Micro-Farad decided to
seek out a cute little coil to let him discharge.  He picked up Milli-Amp
and took her for a ride on his Megacycle.  They rode across the Wheatstone
bridge, around the sine waves, and stopped in the magnetic field by the
flowing current.  Micro-Farad, attracted by Milli-Amp's charactaristic curves,
soon had her fully charged and excited, her resistance to a minimum.  He laid
her on the ground potential, raised her frequency, and lowered her reluctance.
He pulled out his high voltage probe and inserted it into her socket,
connecting them in parallel and began short circuiting her resistance shunt.
Fully excited, Milli-Amp mumbled:  "OHM-OHM-OHM."
	With his tube operating at a maximum and her field vibrating with
his current flow, it caused her shunt to overheat, and Micro-Farad was rapidly
discharged and drained of every electron.  They Fluxed all night trying
various connections and sockets until his magnet had a soft core and lost
all of its field strength.
	Afterwards, Milli-Amp tried self-induction  and  damaged  her
solenoids.  With his battery fully discharged, Micro-Farad was unable to
excite his field, so they spent the night reversing polarity and blowing
each others fuses.

One of my favorite Zoo jokes has to do with a woman who, while

kind, the woman steps back and gives him a raspberry...!
	The gorilla becomes enraged.  He rips the bars from his cage, grabs
the woman, drags her back into the cage, and ravishes her.  While doing so,
he inflicts a great deal of harm upon her person.
	Later, at the hospital, a neighbor of the woman visits and exclaims,
"Oh, you poor dear...!  Are you hurt?"

he just spots a glimmer of her face.  Gorgeous!  She moves, and her vestments

Could we maybe talk?"

the bus driver asks the guy if he was the person bothering the nun.  The man
starts apologizing, but the bus driver interrupts him.  "No, don't apologize,
I was checking her out myself.  Listen, you see where she got on?  She goes
there every day, to a little park.  Why don't you meet here there?"
	Sure enough, the man goes to the park the next day and there's the nun
in a secluded grove of trees.  He approaches her, and she seems, although shy,
much more willing to talk.  After an hour of cautious talk, he asks her if
she'd be willing to make love with him.  She blushes, smiles, blushes again
and says "yes".  But that she doesn't dare risk getting pregnant, so it would
have to be the "back door".

panting, he says, "Sister, I have to tell you, I'm the guy who was annoying

The largest gay community in the U.S. (as a percentage of total population)
is not in San Francisco, but in Iowa Falls, Minnesota (pop. 763), a small
town in which virtually everyone is gay.  In 1976, a group of about 100
gays fleeing persecution in the South settled in the town, and soon won a
majority on the town council.  Ordinances prohibiting heterosexual acts
soon followed.  "After all," said mayor Harry Whalen, "If the Supreme Court
has refused to strike down laws prohibiting homosexual acts, then our
anti-straight laws are equally valid."  Rigorous enforcement of those laws
has resulted in a community that is now almost 100% gay.  Said one long-time
resident: "I've lived here 35 years and didn't want to leave, but I didn't
want to give up sex either.  Then my neighbor Ed came over one night, and
said how about I do it with him, and my wife Millie could do it with his
wife.  Well, I found it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it was gonna be.
Fact is, I rather like it."

The woman hurried home from her doctor's appointment, devastated by the
medical report she had just received.  When her husband came in from work,
she told him, "Darling, the doctor said I have only twelve more hours to
live.  So I've decided I want to go to bed and make passionate love to you
throughout the night.  How does that sound, dearest?"
	"Hey, that's fine for ___you," replied the husband.  "You don't have
to get up in the morning!"

The young girl was having a heart-to-heart talk with her mother on her
first visit home since starting college.
	"Mom, I have to tell you," the girl confessed.  "I lost my virginity
last weekend."
	"I'm not suprised," said her mother.  "It was bound to happen sooner
or later.  I just hope it was a romantic and pleasurable experience."
	"Well, yes and no," the pretty student remarked.  "The first eight
guys felt great, but after them my pussy got real sore."

	The young man took a blind date to the amusement park.  They went
for a ride on the Ferris wheel.  The ride completed, she seemed rather bored.
"What would you like to do next?" he asked.
	"I wanna get weighed," she said.  So he took her over to the weight
guesser.  Next they rode the roller coaster.  After that he bought her some
popcorn and cotton candy, then he asked what else she would like to do.
	"I wanna get weighed," she said, bluntly.
	I really latched onto a square one tonight, thought the boy, and
using the excuse that he had developed a headache, he took the girl home.
The girl's mother was surprised to see her home so early, and asked, "What's
wrong, dear, didn't you have a nice time tonight?"
	"Wousy," said the girl.

The young stud walked into a bordello.  After he took his clothes off, the

	"Well, ma'am", replied the stud, "there are two things I just can't

Then there was the middle-aged businessman who took his spouse to Paris.
After traipsing with her from one mansion du couture to another, be begged
for a day off to rest and got it.  With the wife gone shopping again, he
went to the Ritz Bar and picked up a luscious parisienne.  They got on
well until the question of money came up.  She wanted a hundred American
dollars; he offered fifty.  They couldn't get together on the price; so
they didn't get together.  That evening he escorted his wife to one of the
nicer restaurants on the Rue de Rivoli, and there he spotted his gorgeous
babe of the afternoon seated at a table near the door.
	"See, monsieur?" she said as they passed her.  "Look what you got

There are two couples that want to convert to Catholicism.  They go
and see a priest and he tells them that the first requirement is to abstain
from sex for thirty days.
	Thirty days later, the couples come back to see the priest.  He asks
the first couple if they passed the test.
	"Father, we didn't so much as TOUCH one another during the last month.
	"Congratulations," the priest replies, "you are now qualified to enter
the Church."  Then, the priests asked the second couple how they did.
	"Well, Father," the husband says, "everything was going just fine
until the 27th day.  My wife bent over the freezer to get something out, and
I just happened to notice that she didn't have any panties on.  I couldn't
stand it any more, so I walked over to her, dropped my pants, and slipped it
to her right there."
	"That's DISGUSTING!", the priest bellows.  "I can never let you into
the Church after something like that."
	"I understand Father," the man replies sadly, "they won't let us
into Safeway anymore either."

There are two trees in the forest.  They are very proud trees.  One day
they notice a sapling half-way between them.
	One tree proclaims, "That is a son of beech!"
	"No, that is a son of a birch!" insists the other.
	"A son of a BEECH!"
	"A son of a BIRCH!"
	"Son of a beech!"
	"Son of a birch!"

The fighting attracts a woodpecker who informs them that he can tell what
kind of tree the sapling is by its taste.  First he tastes the beech and
the birch.  Then he tastes the sapling.  "Well now, is that a son of a
beech or a son of a birch?" asks the beech.
	"You're both wrong!" says the bird.  "That's the best piece of ash
I've had my pecker in for a long time!"

There was once a newly-married couple.  Now these two lovers were, well,
rather uptight about using expressions such as "having sex", "getting it on",
or "boffing the brains out".  So, they decided to use the euphemism, "doing
the laundry" whenever the topic of sex came up. 
	One evening, hubby said, "Well, honey, feel like doing some laundry 
tonite?", and she consented.  The next evening, hubby again asked, "Sweetie, 
feel like doing some laundry tonite?"  Well, wifey wasn't really in the mood, 
but complied.  On the third night, when hubby approached her, asking her to 
participate in doing still MORE laundry, she replied, "Oh, Hon, I'm really not 
in the mood for doing any laundry tonite."
	Well, hubby, being a bit disappointed, locked himself in the bathroom 
and engaged in a spot of self-abuse instead.  Upon returning to the living
room, wifey said, "Well, Poopsie, I've changed my mind -- how about doing
some laundry?"  To which he replied, "Oh, no, that's okay, I just did a small
load!"

These two project managers were walking through a residential area
one day, when they saw a dog (also male) sitting on a lawn, licking its
cock.  (Why do dogs do that?  Because they can).  Anyway, the first manager

it once, and the damn dog bit me!"

They watched the sun slowly sink behind the hills, and the fiery glow on
the lake fade into darkness. He eyed her shadowy figure, accentuated by
the moonlight, as the tension from within began to fuel his animalistic
desires. She followed him, ever so quietly, as they sought a secluded
corner in the barn.  Alone!  At last.  His hands roamed about her soft
back, around to her thighs, and finally caressed her budding nipples.
Oh, how smooth and succulent she was!  "Was it so wrong?", he asked
himself.  No, he thought, for his father had done it, as did his own
father, ad infinitum.  The boiling, uncontrollable rage within him became
unbearable.  She signalled her eagerness, spreading her legs, as he
grasped her nipples again.  Stroking, again and again, longer each time.
It began coming; again, again, again, again.  His mind raced with fear
"Will it stop?".  Exhausted, he lay down beside her. "Dear God, what have
I done?".  Suddenly, his father burst in.  His eyes burned as he stared
for what seemed an eternity.  Finally, his father spoke.
	"Son, you ain't supposed to milk the damn cow till mornin'!"

	"Do you always jog in the nude?"
	"Yes ma'am!" he replies.
	"Does it always result in that kind of sexual excitement?" she asks.
	"Yes ma'am!" he replies.
	"Do you always wear a condom?"

Three women always hang their laundry out in the backyard.  When it rains,
however, the laundry always gets wet.  All the laundry, that is, except
for Laurie's.  Laurie never seems to have her laundry out when it rains.
	So, one day, they are all out in the backyard putting their clothes
on the line when one of the women says to Laurie, "Laurie, how come when it
never rains when you have your laundry out?"
	"Well," replies Laurie, "when I wake up in the morning, I check out
my husband Paul.  If his penis is hanging over his right leg, I know it's
going to be a great day.  If his penis is hanging over his left leg, I know
it might rain.  I don't know why it works, but he's never been wrong!"
	"Laurie, what if he has an erection?" asks the other woman.
	"Honey, on a day like *that*, you don't do the *laundry."

	"I would pass them, and hope that I could fend them off," responded

Two buddies had been out drinking for hours when their money finally

shum money from my wife."
	The two of them reeled into Al's living room, snapped on the light, 
and lo and behold, there was Al's wife making love on the sofa to another man.
This state of affairs considerably unnerved Al's friend but didn't seem to

	"Shay, dear, you have any money for your ever-lovin' hushban'?" he
asked.
	"Yes, yes," she snapped.  "Take my purse from the mantle, and for

enough here for a pint for you and a pint for me.  Pretty good, eh, old buddy?"

alarm clock for two hours later.  When it went off we made love again.
Then, I reset it for the morning and we made love once more before I came
to work.  I feel like a bull!"
	His friend says, "Well, that *is* fantastic!  I'm going to have
to give it a try."  So, he goes home that night and makes love to his
wife.  Figuring he doesn't need to set the alarm clock, he settles off
to sleep.  Waking up a few hours later, he nudges his wife and they make love
again.  Waking up in the morning he makes love to his wife for the third
time.  Looking over at the clock he realizes that he's twenty minutes late
for work.  He throws on his clothes and runs down to the subway.  When
he gets to the factory his boss is standing there waiting.
	"Frank", he says, "I've been working for you for 18 years, and I've

Two midgets arrived at the convent door and asked to speak with the Mother
Superior.  Led into her office, the first one asked respectfully "Excuse

	Receiving a reply to the negative, he asked whether any midget
nuns were to be found in any of the neighboring parish.  Again the reply
was no.
	The tiny man scratched his head and posed a final question.  "Beggin'
your pardon, Mother Superior, but would you know of *any* midget nuns at

love every day."
	"You're kidding!" says his friend.  "How do you do it?"
	"Pumpernickel bread.  That's the secret."  And he dashes off home.
	The other man starts to walk home.  "Hmmm," he thinks to himself
pumpernickel bread.  Well, it's worth a try."  So he goes into a nearby
bakery.
	Going up to the woman at the counter, he asks for their entire stock
of pumpernickel bread.  The woman stares at him in astonishment.  "You want

seconds after you get up the courage to ask him for the time, since almost
invariably he can't speak English, and if he can, he always says, "Why,

"Hey, you," yelled one of them, "did you see a woman come by here?"
	"Yes," replied the hunter.  "What's the trouble?"
	"She's an inmate of the county asylum, and gets loose every now and
then.  We're trying to catch her."
	"I can understand that," said the hunter, "But why is one of you
carrying a bucket of sand?"

While vacationing last summer in the North Woods, a young fellow thought it
might be a good idea to write his girl.  He had brought no stationery with
him, however; so he had to walk into town for some.  Entering the one and
only general store, he discovered that the clerk was a young, full-blown farm
girl with languorous eyes.
	"Do you keep stationery?" he asked.
	"Well," she giggled, "I do until the last few seconds, and then I
just go wild."

While visiting our country, a lovely French maiden found herself
out of money just as her visa expired.  Unable to pay her passage back to
France, she was in despair until an enterprising sailor made her a sporting
proposition.  "My ship is sailing tonight," he said.  "I'll smuggle you
aboard, hide you down in the hold and provide you with a mattress, blankets
and food.  All it will cost you is a little love."
	The girl consented, and late that night the sailor sneaked her on
board his vessel.  Twice each day thereafter, the sailor smuggled a large
tray of food below decks, took his pleasure with the little French stowaway
and departed.  The days turned into weeks, and the weeks might have turned
into months if the captain hadn't noticed the sailor carrying food below one
evening and followed him.  After witnessing this unique bit of barter, he
waited until the sailor had departed and then confronted the girl, demanding
an explanation.  She told him the whole story.
	"Hmmm," mused the captian.  "A clever arrangement, and I must say I
admire that young seaman's ingenuity.  However, miss, I feel it is only fair
to tell you that this is the Staten Island Ferry."

A Scotsman clad in kilts left a bar one evening fair.
One could tell by how he walked, he'd drunk more than his share.
He staggered on until he could no longer keep his feet.
So he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.

Later on two young and lovely girls just happened by.
One says to the other, with a twinkle in her eye.
"See yon sleeping Scotsman so young and handsome built?"
"I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath their kilts?"

They stepped up to the Scotsman, so young and fancy free.
They lifted up his kilt above the waist so they could see.
And there behold for them the view beneath his Scottish skirt,
Was nothing more than God had graced him with upon his birth.

They marveled for a moment, then one said, "Best be gone."
"Let's leave a present for our friend before we move along."
As a gift they left a blue ribbon tied into a bow,
Around the bonny star of the Scot's kilt lifting show.

The Scot awoke to nature's call and stumbled to the trees.
Behind a bush he lifts his kilt and gawks at what he see's.
Then in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes,
"Och, lad I dinna know whar' ya been, but I see ya won first prize."

	Is the Mind the all-creating source?

How could they think women a recreation?
Or the repetition of bodies of steady interest?
Only the ignorant or the busy could.  That elm
of flesh must prove a luxury of primes;
be perilous and dear with rain of an alternate earth.
Which is not to damn the forested China of touching.
I am neither priestly nor tired, and the great knowledge
of breasts with their loud nipples congregates in me.
The sudden nakedness, the small ribs, the mouth.
Splendid.  Splendid.  Splendid.  Like Rome.  Like loins.
A glamour sufficient to our long marvelous dying.
I say sufficient and speak with earned privilege,
for my life has been eaten in that foliate city.
To ambergris.  But not for recreation.
I would not have lost so much for recreation.

Nor for love as the sweet pretend: the children's game
of deliberate ignorance of each to allow the dreaming.
Not for the impersonal belly nor the heart's drunkenness
have I come this far, stubborn, disasterous way.
But for relish of those archipelagoes of person.
To hold her in hand, closed as any sparrow,
and call and call forever till she turn from bird
to blowing woods.  From woods to jungle.  Persimmon.
To light.  From light to princess.  From princess to woman
in all her fresh particularity of difference.
Then oh, through the underwater time of night
indecent and still, to speak to her without habit.
This I have done with my life, and am content.
I wish I could tell you how it is in that dark,
standing in the huge singing and the alien world.

Comb out the hair and compare it to brother.

Pants would seem tighter and buckle and bulge.

Much to his Mum and Dad's dismay, Horace ate himself one day.
He didn't stop to say his grace, he just sat down and ate his face.
"We can't have this!" his Dad declared, "If that lad's ate, he should
	be shared."
But even as he spoke they saw Horace eating more and more:
First his legs and then his thighs, his arms, his nose, his hair, his eyes...
"Stop him someone!" Mother cried, "Those eyeballs would be better fried!"
But all too late, for they were gone, and he had started on his dong...
"Oh! foolish child!" the father mourns "You could have deep-fried that
	with prawns,
Some parsley and and some tartar sauce..."
But H. was on his second course: his liver and his lights and lung,
His ears, his neck, his chin, his tongue; "To think I raised him from the cot,
And now he's going to scoff the lot!"
His Mother cried: "What shall we do?  What's left won't even make a stew..."
And as she wept, her son was seen, to eat his head, his heart his spleen.
and there he lay: a boy no more, just a stomach on the floor...
None the less, since it *was* his, they ate it -- that's what haggis is.

Somebody's moggy, by the side of the road,
Somebody's pussy, who forgot his highway code,
Somebody's favourite feline, who ran clean out of luck,
When he ran onto the road, and tried to argue with a truck.

Yesterday he purred and played, in his pussy paradise,
Decapitating tweety birds, and masticating mice.
Now he's just six pounds of raw mince meat,
That don't smell very nice --
He's nobody's moggy now.

Oh you who love your pussy,
Be sure to keep him in.
Don't let him argue with a truck,	If he tries to play
The truck is bound to win.		On the road way
And upon the busy road,			I'm afraid that will be that,
Don't let him play or frolic.		There will be one last despairing

Harnessed to a cock of steel,

And the whole damn thing was driven by steam.

Round and round went the bloody great wheel,
In and out went the cock of steel,
Till at last the maiden cried,

Here for his envy, will not drive us hence;

To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.

'Twas the night before Christmas -- the very last one --
When the blazing of lasers destroyed all our fun.
Just as Santa had lifted off, driving his sleigh,
A satellite spotted him making his way.
The Star Wars Defense System -- Reagan's desire
Was ready for action, and started to fire!
The laser beams criss-crossed and lit up the sky
Like a fireworks show on the Fourth of July.
I'd just finished wrapping the last of the toys
When out of my chimney there came a great noise.
I looked to the fireplace, hoping to see
St. Nick bringing presents for missus and me.
But what I saw next was disturbing and shocking:
A flaming red jacket setting fire to my stocking!
Charred reindeer remains and a melted sleigh-bell;
Outside burning toys like confetti they fell.
So now you know, children, why Christmas is gone:
The Star Wars computer had got something wrong.
Only programmed for battle, it hadn't a heart;
'Twas hardly a chance it would work from the start.
It couldn't be tested, and no one could tell,
If the crazy contraption would work very well.
So after a trillion or two had been spent
The system thought Santa a Red missle sent.
So kids dry your tears now, and get off to bed,
There won't be a Christmas -- since Santa is dead.

When I need something 
To help me unwind
I find a six-foot baby		What kind of guy
With a one-track mind		Does a lot for me
Smart guys are nowhere		Superman
They make demands		With a lobotomy
Give me a moron			My father's out of Harvard
With talented hands		My brother's out of Yale
I go bar-hopping		Well the guy I took home last night
And they say "Last call"	Just got out of jail
I start shopping 		The way he grabbed and threw me
For a Neanderthal		Oooo, it really got me hot
				But the way he growled and bit me
The bigger they come		I hoped he had his shots
The harder I fall
In love till we're done		The bigger they are
Then they're out in the hall	The harder they'll work
				I got a soft spot
				For a good-looking jerk

When in calling, plain speaking is out;
When the ladies (God bless 'em) are milling about,
You may wet, make water, or empty the glass;
You can powder your nose, or the "johnny" will pass.

When everyone's drunk, it's condensing the fog;
But sure as the devil, that word with a hiss

Don't let your lover tell you,
Don't let anybody sell you,

And now I have an erection all the time.

... which the Minstrel was supposed by some authorities to have composed
beneath the gibbet at Elsdon on the occasion of his hanging, drawing and
quartering for misguidedly climbing into bed with Sir Oswald Capheughton's
wife, Lady Fleur, when that noble lord was not only in it, but in her at
the same time.  Minstrel Flawse's introduction of himself into Sir Oswald
had met with that reaction known as dog-knotting on the part of all
concerned...
I gan noo wha ma organs gan
When oft I lay abed			I should ha' known 'twas never Fleur
So rither hang me upside doon		That smelt so mooch of sweat
Than by ma empty head.			For she was iver sweet and pure
					And iver her purse was wet.
But old Sir Oswald allus stank
Of horse and hound and dung		So hang me noo fra' Elsdon tree
And when I chose to breech his rank	And draw ma innards out
Was barrel to my bung.			That all the wald around may see
					What I have done without.
But ere ye come to draw ma heart
Na do it all so quick			So prick 'em wet or prick 'em dry
But prise the arse of Oswald 'part	'Tis all the same to me
And bring me back ma prick.		I canna wait for him to die
					Afore I have a pee.

While sitting 'neath an oak one morn
In thought on this and that,
A tiny, twitt'ring little bird		"Oh tiny bird, O Nature's gift
A load dropped in my hat.		Of music and of wit!
					Why didst thou feel that my best hat
"Thy music gladdens my poor soul,	Was thy best place to shit?"
And brings joy to my heart.
But tell me, little bird divine,	The tiny bird a few notes sang,
Why didst thou not just fart?"		Then answer'd "Pardon me,
					For thy hat I thought was my nest,
I rose and stood in solemn awe		A-fallen from the tree."

Then lifted up a paving block
And crushed his fucking skull.

Willie in the cauldron fell;		Willie saw some dynamite,
See the grief on mother's brow;		Couldn't understand it quite;
Mother loved her darling well --	Curiosity never pays:
Willie's quite hard-boiled by now.	It rained Willie seven days.

Little Willie with a shout,		William in a nice new sash,
Gouged the baby's eyeballs out;		Fell in the fire and burned to an ash.
Stamped on them to make them pop.	Now, although the room grows chilly,
Mother cried, "Now, William, stop!"	I haven't the heart to poke poor Billy.

William with a thirst for gore,		Little Willie mean as hell,
Nailed the baby to the door.		Threw his sister in the well!

"Careful, Will, don't mar the paint."	'sure is hard to raise a daughter.'

A grade school teacher, who was doing a unit on World War II heard that
the father of one of her students had been a fighter pilot during the war
with one of the Scandinavian Air Forces.  She invited him to come in and
speak to the class.  The guy was more than happy to talk, and began with
a story about a morning patrol where he had been nearly shot down.
	"We had been up for about 20 minutes flying over enemy held
territory, when we noticed, just in time, 3 fokkers diving on us from above."
At the first mention of `fokkers' the class giggled a little bit.
	"Our group broke formation, and began the dog-fighting.  As we
fought, we noticed 2 more fokkers coming at us from above and 2 more
fokkers, fresh from the landing field, come to join the battle".
At this second and third mention of `fokkers' the class was almost laughing
openly, and the teacher interrupted the story to ask the pilot to explain
to the class that a 'fokker' was a particular type of plane flown by the
German Air Force.
	He replied, "Ya, dat is true, but these fokkers were Messerschmidts".

8.  Either fix yourself something to eat, or wait for me and we'll eat when
I get home."
	Well, he decided to wait until his wife returned.  However, his
stomach started to growl and he remembered that he had an apple left over
from his lunch.  He got the apple, polished it a little, and heard the
doorbell ring.  He went to the door and there stood a little blond haired
girl holding out a little paper bag.  "Trick or treat", she said.
	He looked at the girl, looked at the apple, thought how hungry he
was, looked at the girl again, and with a slight sigh dropped his apple in

complained, "You stupid son-of-a-bitch.  You broke my cookies!"

the inevitable exclamation, his wife reproves him with "Honey!"
	This continues on, with his golfing getting worse and his wife getting
more and more upset about his language.  Finally, on the 17th hole, he again
misses a very easy putt.  Flinging his club down, he curses the hole, the
club, and the sunset, using the word "fuck" for the first time.  His wife
whirls around and cries, "Honey!  Our daughter is standing right next to you!"
	Feeling remorseful, but somewhat defensive, he turns to the

A retired schoolteacher finally decided that she was tired of living alone
and wanted some companionship, so after a good deal of thought she decided
to visit the local pet shop.  The owner suggested a parrot, with which she
could conduct a civilized conversation.  This seemed to be an excellent
idea, so she bought a handsome parrot, sat him on a perch in her living room,
and said, "Say 'Pretty boy.'"  Silence from the bird.  "Come on now, say
'Pretty boy ... pretty boy.'"
	At long last, disgustedly, the bird said, "Oh, shit."
	Shocked, the schoolteacher said, "Just for that, you get five minutes
in the refrigerator."  Five minutes later she put the shivering bird back on
its perch and said, "Now let's hear it: 'Pretty boy ... pretty boy.'"
	"Damn it, wouldja lay off, lady?" said the parrot.
	Outraged, the woman grabbed the bird, said, "That's it!  Ten minutes
in the freezer," and slammed the door on him.
	Hopping about to keep warm, what does the parrot come across but a
big frozen turkey waiting for Thanksgiving.  Startled, he squawks, "My God,

Churchill was known to drain a glass or two and, after one
particularly convivial evening, he chanced to encounter Miss Bessie Braddock,
a Socialist member of the House of Commons, who, upon seeing his condition,
said, "Winston, you're drunk."  Mustering all his dignity, Churchill drew
himself up to his full height, cocked an eyebrow and rejoined, "Shove it up
your ass, you ugly cunt."
	When the noted playwright George Bernard Shaw sent him two tickets to
the opening night of his new play with a note that read: "Bring a friend, if
you have one," Churchill, not to be outdone, promptly wired back: "You and
your play can go fuck yourselves."
	At an elegant dinner party, Lady Astor once leaned across the table
to remark, "If you were my husband, Winston, I'd poison your coffee."  "And
if you were my wife, I'd beat the shit out of you," came Churchill's

Luftwaffe bombers raining death and destruction on a near-defenseless London,
Prime Minister Churchill went on the air to address the British people.  "I
read this morning's paper that Herr Hitler plans to wring England's neck like
that of a chicken," he began, "and I was reminded of what the Irish poacher
said as he stood on the gallows.  It seems the poor fellow was approached by a
well-meaning if somewhat overzealous priest who, in horrific detail, described
the unfading torments of Hades which awaited him if he did not repent of his
misdeeds. The condemned man listened patiently to all that the priest had to
say, and when he was done, grinned broadly and replied, 'Eat it raw, fuzz

Here is the problem: for many years, the Supreme Court wrestled with the issue
of pornography, until finally Associate Justice John Paul Stevens came up with
the famous quotation about how he couldn't define pornography, but he knew it
when he saw it.  So for a while, the court's policy was to have all the
suspected pornography trucked to Justice Stevens' house, where he would look it
over.  "Nope, this isn't it," he'd say.  "Bring some more."  This went on until
one morning when his housekeeper found him trapped in the recreation room under
an enormous mound of rubberized implements, and the court had to issue a ruling
stating that it didn't know what the hell pornography was except that it was
illegal and everybody should stop badgering the court about it because the
court was going to take a nap.

	If put to a pinch, an ounce of loyalty is worth a pound of cleverness.
	If you must vilify, condemn and eternally find disparage -- resign your
position, and when you are outside, damn to your heart's content... but, as
long as you are part of the institution do not condemn it.
	If you do that, you are loosening the tendrils that are holding you to
the institution, and at the first high wind that comes along, you will
be uprooted and blown away, and probably will never know the reason why.

In the beginning was the DEMO Project.  And the Project was without form.
And darkness was upon the staff members thereof.  So they spake unto
their Division Head, saying, "It is a crock of shit, and it stinks."

And the Division Head spake unto his Department Head, saying,
"It is a crock of excrement and none may abide the odor thereof."
Now, the Department Head spake unto his Directorate Head, saying,
"It is a container of excrement, and is very strong, such that none
may abide before it."  And it came to pass that the Directorate Head
spake unto the Assistant Technical Director, saying, "It is a vessel
of fertilizer and none may abide by its strength."

And the assistant Technical Director spake thus unto the Technical
Director, saying, "It containeth that which aids growth and it is
very strong."  And, Lo, the Technical Director spake then unto the
Captain, saying, "The powerful new Project will help promote the
growth of the Laboratories."

And the Captain looked down upon the Project, and He saw that it was Good!

It seems there were two young Marines walking down the street, and
they chanced upon a lady who was both very proper and very well endowed.
One of them said, "Wow! What tits!  Hey lady, would I love to snuggle up with
them for awhile.  What are you doing this afternoon?"

Well, the other Marine thought that was just about the most shameful

Corps.  "Pardon my friend, Ma'am," he apologized, "He's not been very well

	On the day of his anniversary, Joe was frantically shopping

grandfather clock for the living room, but he found the right one almost
impossible to find.  Finally, after many hours of searching, Joe found
just the clock he wanted, but the store didn't deliver.  Joe, desperate,
paid the shopkeeper, hoisted the clock onto his back, and staggered out
onto the sidewalk.  On the way home, he passed a bar. Just as he reached
the door, a drunk stumbled out and crashed into Joe, sending himself,
Joe, and the clock into the gutter.  Murphy's law being in effect, the
clock ended up in roughly a thousand pieces.

Once upon a time, there was a non-conforming sparrow who decided not to
fly south for the winter.  However, soon after the weather turned cold,
the sparrow changed his mind and reluctantly started to fly south.
After a short time, ice began to form his on his wings and he fell to
earth in a barnyard almost frozen.  A cow passed by and crapped on this
little bird and the sparrow thought it was the end, but the manure
warmed him and defrosted his wings.  Warm and happy the little sparrow
began to sing.  Just then, a large Tom cat came by and hearing the
chirping investigated the sounds.  As Old Tom cleared away the manure,
he found the chirping bird and promptly ate him.

	Shortly after Churchill had grown a moustache, he was accosted by a
certain young lady whose political views were in direct opposition to his
own.  Fancying herself something of a wag, she exclaimed, "Mr. Churchill, I
care for neither your politics nor your moustache."  Unabashed, the young
statesman regarded her quietly for a moment, the wryly commented, "Suck my
dick."
	While serving as a subaltern in the Boer War, the young Churchill was
asked by a superior officer to give his opinion of the Boers as soldiers.
 "They're assholes, sir," he ventured, then paused briefly and added, with a
whimsical smile, "They're assholes."
	Churchill was given to reading in the bathtub and, while staying at
the White House, he once became so engrossed in an account of the Battle of
Fonteney that he forgot President Roosevelt was due to drop by to discuss the
upcoming conference in Yalta.  At the appointed hour, the President was
wheeled into Churchill's quarters only to be informed that the Prime Minister
had not finished bathing.  Roosevelt was about to apologize for the intrusion
and depart when Churchill, puffing his customary cigar, strode into the room
stark naked and greeted the nonplussed world leader with a terse, "What are
you staring at, homo?"

The boys in the Epperson family all acquired fine educations except for Edward.
They made him go to school, but most of the time he just ignored what was said

	One day Edward was sitting at home looking at a magazine, and he said
to his brilliant older brother, Hud, he said, "Hud, what does fox pass mean?"
	Brother Hud gave the question some deep consideration and then said,
"You must mean _faux_pas_."
	"The way it's spelled," said dumb Ed, "it's fox pass."

phrase -- it means a social blunder.  Remember last Sunday when the Bishop came
for dinner?  Mother took him out in the garden and they were looking over the
roses when the Bishop got stuck on the thumb by a thorn.  It was bleeding quite
a bit so Mother brought him in the house.  They went into the bathroom together
and stayed quite a while, and when they came out we all went to the dinner
table.  Remember all that, Ed?"
	"Yeh."
	"Now," Hud continued, "you recall that I was just getting to pass
the gravy when Mother said, 'Bishop, does your prick still throb?'  The gravy
bowl flew out of my hands and hit the table, and the gravy splattered all
over everyone.  And just at that point you, Brother Edward, you hollered,
'Sheee-itt!'  You remember that?"

Two morticians alternated in sharing the responsibility of covering 
the night shift. One early morning about 3:00 am, a body was brought into the 
mortuary, and the mortician began work.  When he had unclothed the corpse, he 
noticed a cork in the anus. Removing it, the strains of "Hello, Dolly, well, 
hello, Dolly...!" were plainly heard being sung.  He put the cork back, and 
the singing stopped. Pulling it out again, the same song started, "You're 
lookin' swell, Dolly!".  Amazed, he telephoned his partner, and insisted he 
come immediately to see something very unusual. Roused from sleep, the partner
asked if it could wait until morning. It took great persistence, but finally 
the partner agreed to dress and come down to the shop.  When he got there, he 
said, "Now what was it that was so important you had to get me out of bed at

partner looks at him disgustedly and says:  "You brought me down here at

so good, he went out and cornered a small monkey and roared at him: "WHO IS

him down; picks him up again, and shakes him until the tiger is just a blur of

Well, this woman went to the butcher shop to get some ham for dinner.
She asked the butcher what kind of ham he recommended, and the butcher said,
